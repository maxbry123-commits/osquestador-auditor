"""Lifecycle tests for ephemeral memory: TTL expiry, reinforcement, promotion, durability.

These tests validate the README claims:
  - Ephemeral facts expire after TTL
  - Reinforcement (auto-promotion via query hits) prevents expiry
  - Explicit promotion clears TTL and overrides expiry
  - Durable facts are never swept by the TTL worker

Design note on time control
---------------------------
The engine pre-sets ``valid_until`` at commit time for facts with ``ttl_days``.
The ``expire_ttl_facts`` sweep targets storage-level facts that have ``ttl_days``
but no ``valid_until`` (e.g. low-level inserts).  Passing ``as_of`` to
``expire_ttl_facts`` simulates the sweep running in the future without any
real sleep — deterministic, instant, no wall-clock dependency.
