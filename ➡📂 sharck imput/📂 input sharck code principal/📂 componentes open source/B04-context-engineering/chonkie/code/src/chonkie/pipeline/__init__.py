"""Module for pipeline.

This module provides infrastructure for building and managing Chonkie pipelines.
Components can be registered using decorators and then composed into pipelines
that follow the CHOMP (CHOnkie's Multi-step Pipeline) architecture.

The CHOMP pipeline stages are:
1. Fetcher - Retrieve raw data
2. Vision - Extract text from visual documents (OCR)
3. Chef - Preprocess and transform
4. Chunker - Split into chunks
5. Refinery - Post-process chunks
6. Porter - Export to storage formats
7. Handshake - Ingest into vector databases
