## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/open-codebase-index.git
   cd open-codebase-index
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```
4. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.19 or newer for development (required by the Pi development dependencies). Node.js 24 LTS is recommended. The published package supports Node.js 22.13 or newer.
- Rust toolchain (for native module)
- npm

### Building

```bash
# Build everything (TypeScript + Rust)
npm run build

# Build only TypeScript
npm run build:ts

# Build only Rust native module
npm run build:native
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:run

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test

# Run Rust tests
cd native && cargo test
```

### Linting

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Run Clippy (Rust)
cd native && cargo clippy
```

## Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and add tests if applicable

3. **Run checks** before committing:
   ```bash
   npm run build && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run test:run
   ```

4. **Commit with a descriptive message**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add my feature"
   ```
   
   We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat:` - New feature
   - `fix:` - Bug fix
   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `perf:` - Performance improvement
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `test:` - Adding/updating tests
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

5. **Push and open a pull request**:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-feature
    ```

### Adding a new language?

If you're contributing parser or call-graph support for a new language, use [`docs/adding-language-support.md`](./docs/adding-language-support.md). It explains the difference between file discovery, semantic parsing, and call-graph support, and lists every code path you may need to update.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and atomic
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review
- Add at least one release category label (`feature`, `bug`, `performance`, `documentation`, `dependencies`, `refactor`, `test`, or `chore`)

## Release Labels and Notes

This repository enforces release labels in CI (`Release Label Check`).

- Every PR must include at least one release category label (`feature`, `bug`, `performance`, `documentation`, `dependencies`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `skip-changelog`).
- Use `semver:major`, `semver:minor`, or `semver:patch` when the change should explicitly drive the release bump.
- Use `skip-changelog` only for intentionally excluded changes.
