# Configuration

Configuration is optional. Defaults are applied when fields are omitted.

## Configuration locations

| Host | Project config | Project index | Global config | Global index |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OpenCode | `.opencode/codebase-index.json` | `.opencode/index/` | `~/.config/opencode/codebase-index.json` | `~/.opencode/global-index/` |
| Claude | `.claude/codebase-index.json` | `.claude/index/` | `~/.claude/codebase-index.json` | `~/.claude/global-index/` |
| Codex, Pi, Jcode | `.codebase-index/config.json` | `.codebase-index/index/` | `~/.config/codebase-index/config.json` | `~/.codebase-index/global-index/` |

Non-OpenCode hosts can fall back to existing OpenCode configuration or index state when a host-specific location does not exist.

Linked worktrees without their own host-specific project config inherit both the config and project index from the main checkout. Project-owned paths are stored relative to the project root, while branch catalogs and branch-scoped runtime state keep each checkout's contents separate. Adding a project config inside a worktree creates a local config and index boundary instead.

Because inheriting worktrees operate on the same project index, clearing or force-rebuilding it from one checkout affects the main checkout and every other inheriting worktree. Legacy project indexes that contain absolute stored paths must be rebuilt once with `index_codebase` and `force: true`. Global indexes continue to use canonical absolute paths.

Git project indexes store file-change and retry state in `file-hashes.<branch-hash>.json` and `failed-batches.<branch-hash>.json`. Non-Git project indexes and global indexes keep the unnamespaced `file-hashes.json` and `failed-batches.json` filenames.

## Minimal example

```json
{
  "embeddingProvider": "auto",
  "scope": "project"
}
```

## Embedding providers

Supported values:

- `auto`
- `ollama`
- `openai`
- `google`
- `custom`

Automatic detection order:

1. Ollama
2. OpenAI
3. Google

### Ollama

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

```json
{
  "embeddingProvider": "ollama"
}
```

#### Choosing an Ollama embedding model

`nomic-embed-text` remains the default local model. It is the smallest tested
option and is a good starting point for most projects:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

For a quality-focused local index, set `embeddingModel` explicitly. The
following models were measured locally on the representative and frozen
cross-repository cohorts:

| Goal | Model | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Small, fast default | `nomic-embed-text` | Lowest storage and latency among the tested models |
| Balanced quality | `embeddinggemma` | Higher ranking quality with moderately higher latency and storage |
| Maximum tested local quality | `qwen3-embedding:0.6b` | Best measured cross-repository nDCG, with higher latency and storage |

For example, to use the balanced option:

```bash
ollama pull embeddinggemma
```

```json
{
  "embeddingProvider": "ollama",
  "embeddingModel": "embeddinggemma"
}
```

Changing an embedding model requires a force rebuild of its index. Check the
current state with `index_status`, then run `index_codebase` with `force: true`.
Keep the default when the additional local model download and query latency are
not worthwhile for your project. See the [local model comparison](benchmarks/2026-08-12-local-embedding-model-comparison.md)
for the methodology and measured results.

#### Batching Ollama embeddings

The indexer sends multiple embedding texts to Ollama in one request. This decreases
the number of HTTP requests and accelerates indexing against a remote Ollama host.
The `/api/embed` endpoint accepts an array of texts and returns one vector per
text. The indexer uses this endpoint for batches of two or more texts. A single-text
batch uses the legacy `/api/embeddings` endpoint. A chunk that the splitter divides
into multiple parts sends one text per part, so a batch can carry several parts of
the same chunk.

If the batched endpoint is not available, the indexer falls back to the legacy
per-text endpoint and remembers the result, so later batches skip the probe. If one
text exceeds the model context length, the indexer truncates and retries that text
by itself. If the batch response is malformed, the indexer retries each text by
itself so a bad batch response re-embeds each text cleanly. This is not in-run
per-text isolation: if a text then hard-fails per-text, the whole request batch
fails and is marked failed. The chunks in that batch recover on the next `index()`
run, where the recovery path re-embeds one text per request so a persistently-failing
text is isolated from healthy texts.

Control the batch size with the `embedding.batch` section:

```json
{
  "embedding": {
    "batch": {
      "maxBatchItems": 32,
      "maxBatchTokens": 65536
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Ollama default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `maxBatchItems` | `16` | Maximum number of embedding texts in one request |
| `maxBatchTokens` | `65536` | Maximum total estimated tokens in one request |

Ollama encodes each text independently. The model context length applies to each
text and not to the batch total. Set `maxBatchTokens` to bound the request size and
the processing time. Set `maxBatchItems` to bound the number of texts (a chunk split
into multiple parts counts as one text per part). Both values are optional and must
be at least 1. When you omit a value, the indexer uses the Ollama default. These
knobs apply only to the Ollama provider; OpenAI, Google, and custom providers ignore
them and keep their existing request behavior.

The indexer runs up to five Ollama requests at the same time. Each request carries
up to `maxBatchItems` texts, so the worst case is five times `maxBatchItems` texts
in flight (80 texts at the default 16). A remote or memory-limited Ollama host can
run out of memory or exceed the 120-second request timeout when this number is too
high. Lower `maxBatchItems` for a small or remote host. The Ollama concurrency is
fixed at five and is not configurable; the custom provider exposes concurrency
through `customProvider.concurrency`.

### OpenAI and Google

Set the provider and corresponding environment credentials:

```json
{
  "embeddingProvider": "openai"
}
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

For Google, use `embeddingProvider: "google"` and configure the Google API credentials expected by your environment.

`github-copilot` is no longer supported for embeddings because GitHub Models retired its inference API. Migrate to OpenAI, Google, Ollama, or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint, then force-rebuild the index.

### Google models

`gemini-embedding-2` is available with Google's recommended code-retrieval query and document formatting. The default remains `gemini-embedding-001` until retrieval benchmarking supports changing it.

### Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint

```json
{
  "embeddingProvider": "custom",
  "customProvider": {
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
    "model": "nomic-embed-text",
    "dimensions": 768,
    "maxTokens": 8192,
    "timeoutMs": 30000,
    "concurrency": 3,
    "requestIntervalMs": 0
  }
}
```

The `/embeddings` path is appended to `baseUrl`. `apiKey` and `maxBatchSize` are optional.

Changing provider, model, dimensions, or embedding strategy can make an existing index incompatible. Check `index_status` and rebuild with `force: true` only when required.

## Scope

```json
{
  "scope": "project"
}
```

- `project`: store the index with the repository.
- `global`: use the host-specific global index path.

## Indexing defaults

| Option | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `autoIndex` | `false` | Run first-use automatic indexing for retrieval tools |
| `autoIndexWaitMs` | `10000` | Maximum first-use wait time |
| `autoIndexMaxRetries` | `5` | Transient lock retries |
| `autoIndexRetryDelayMs` | `100` | Initial retry delay |
| `watchFiles` | `true` | Watch files and branches for incremental updates |
| `pauseBackgroundIndexingOnBattery` | `false` | On macOS, defer automatic background indexing on battery |
| `maxFileSize` | `1048576` | Maximum file size in bytes |
| `maxChunksPerFile` | `100` | Maximum semantic chunks per file |
| `semanticOnly` | `false` | Skip generic blocks and keep semantic chunks |
| `retries` | `3` | Embedding retry attempts |
| `retryDelayMs` | `1000` | Initial embedding retry delay |
| `autoGc` | `true` | Enable automatic orphan cleanup |
| `gcIntervalDays` | `7` | Cleanup interval |
| `gcOrphanThreshold` | `100` | Orphan threshold for cleanup |
| `requireProjectMarker` | `true` | Require `.git`, `package.json`, or another project marker before watching |
| `maxDepth` | `5` | Directory traversal depth; `-1` is unlimited |
| `maxFilesPerDirectory` | `100` | Per-directory file cap |
| `fallbackToTextOnMaxChunks` | `true` | Fall back to line chunks when the semantic cap is reached, except for sanitized XML and SVG chunks |
| `linesPerChunk` | `30` | Max lines per chunk for line-based parsing (`.jsonl`, `.txt`, unknown extensions, and the AST fallback). Lower it for finer-grained retrieval on line-delimited files. Only the line-based path is affected; AST-parsed languages are unchanged |
| `gitBlame.enabled` | `false` | Store git blame metadata for filtering |

XML and SVG are opt-in formats. Add `**/*.xml` or `**/*.svg` to `additionalInclude` when they are useful to the project. XML chunks preserve element paths, text, and bounded attributes. SVG chunks preserve `text`, `title`, `desc`, and accessibility attributes while excluding geometry, styles, classes, and layer metadata.

Search and similarity results, as well as external reranker documents, use the reconstructed semantic XML/SVG chunk rather than raw source lines. `contextLines` does not expand markup snippets, and reported line numbers remain the original chunk's source coordinates. If the current source or parser settings no longer reproduce the indexed chunk, its content is reported as unavailable until the file is reindexed.

Example:

```json
{
  "indexing": {
    "autoIndex": false,
    "watchFiles": true,
    "maxFileSize": 1048576,
    "maxChunksPerFile": 100,
    "requireProjectMarker": true,
    "gitBlame": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Search defaults

| Option | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `maxResults` | `20` | Default result limit |
| `minScore` | `0.1` | Minimum accepted score |
| `includeContext` | `true` | Read source context for full results |
| `hybridWeight` | `0.5` | Keyword weight for weighted fusion |
| `fusionStrategy` | `rrf` | `rrf` or `weighted` |
| `rrfK` | `60` | Reciprocal-rank fusion constant |
| `rerankTopN` | `20` | Deterministic reranking pool |
| `contextLines` | `0` | Extra source lines around results |
| `routingHints` | `true` | Inject host routing guidance |
| `routingGraphHandoffHints` | `false` | Include graph handoff guidance |
| `routingHintRole` | `system` | `system` or `developer` |
| `communityBoost` | `0` | Opt-in multiplicative boost (`0` to `1`) for candidates in an exact query symbol's call-graph community |

`communityBoost` is experimental and disabled by default. It activates only when the query contains one unambiguous exact symbol already present in the active branch catalog. Existing branch, directory, file-type, chunk-type, blame, and score filters run first, so community context can reorder only candidates that already passed normal search scope. Missing or ambiguous symbols and unavailable graph data fall back to the existing ranking.

## MCP operation runtime

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "stallTimeoutMs": 300000
  }
}
```

`mcp.stallTimeoutMs` limits inactivity, not total operation duration. Every phase change, heartbeat, and raw indexing progress event rearms the timer. The default is `300000` milliseconds. Set it to `0` to disable stall detection. Positive values are normalized to the safe timer range from `1000` through `2147483647` milliseconds.

The MCP server writes redacted per-process runtime state below `<indexRoot>/mcp-runtime/`. These records contain operation names, phases, timestamps, process identity, and ordered-shutdown state only. They never contain tool arguments, queries, paths, provider URLs, response bodies, raw exception causes, or secrets. Active records are updated atomically, phase changes are persisted immediately, disk heartbeats are limited to one every five seconds, and records older than seven days are removed during status inspection. Cross-process status checks allow one disk-heartbeat interval before reporting a suspected stall so the persistence throttle does not create a false warning.

## Include and exclude patterns

```json
{
  "include": ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"],
  "additionalInclude": ["scripts/**/*.mjs"],
  "exclude": ["**/generated/**"]
}
```

- `include` replaces the default include patterns.
- `additionalInclude` extends the defaults.
- `exclude` replaces the default exclude patterns.
- Matching files are omitted from the index, including paths that also match `include`. Directory globs such as `**/generated/**` skip the whole tree.
- Incremental `/index` and `retryFailedBatches` drop stale failed-batch retries for paths that are now excluded, so previously failed chunks are not re-embedded.
- `.gitignore` is also respected. Tracked Git files can still be excluded from the index with `exclude`; `.git/info/exclude` is not read.

## Knowledge bases

Index additional directories alongside the project:

```json
{
  "knowledgeBases": [
    "../shared-docs",
    "/absolute/path/to/reference-source"
  ]
}
```

Paths can be absolute or relative to the project root. OpenCode and Pi also expose host-native tools for adding, listing, and removing knowledge bases.

### Opt-in PDF text indexing

PDF discovery is disabled by default. To index text-based PDFs in the project or
configured knowledge bases, add an explicit include pattern:

```json
{
  "additionalInclude": ["**/*.pdf"],
  "knowledgeBases": ["../shared-docs"]
}
```

The normal `indexing.maxFileSize` discovery limit still applies first and defaults
to 1 MiB. Increase it explicitly if intended PDFs are larger. After admission, the
PDF extractor also enforces internal defaults of 20 MiB input, 500 physical pages,
and 2,000,000 extracted characters. OCR, password entry, remote downloads, and
image-only PDFs are not supported. Invalid, protected, scanned, blank, or over-limit
documents are reported per file without preventing other files from indexing.

Search and context results cite physical, 1-based positions such as `manual.pdf,
p. 3` or `manual.pdf, pp. 3-4`; source line fields remain reserved for source files.
Extracted text and page metadata are stored inside the index so search, retries, and
reranking do not reread PDF bytes as UTF-8. Treat the index as sensitive plaintext
data and protect it like the source documents. Extraction itself is local, but the
extracted text is sent to the configured embedding provider and, when enabled, the
configured reranker under the same privacy rules as source code.

## External reranking

Reranking is disabled unless configured.

```json
{
  "reranker": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "cohere",
    "model": "rerank-v3.5",
    "apiKey": "...",
    "topN": 20,
    "timeoutMs": 10000
  }
}
```

Providers:

- `cohere`, default base URL `https://api.cohere.ai/v1`
- `jina`, default base URL `https://api.jina.ai/v1`
- `custom`, requires `baseUrl`

When reranking is enabled, `topN` defaults to `15` and `timeoutMs` defaults to `10000`. Directory, file-type, chunk-type, branch, and blame filters are applied before candidates are sent to the reranker.

## Debug and metrics

```json
{
  "debug": {
    "enabled": true,
    "logLevel": "info",
    "metrics": true
  },
  "effectivenessMetrics": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "mcp": {
    "stallTimeoutMs": 300000
  }
}
```

Debug defaults:

- logging disabled
- log level `info`
- search, embedding, cache, GC, and branch categories enabled when logging is active
- operational metrics enabled when debug logging is active

`effectivenessMetrics.enabled` separately opts into privacy-safe, process-lifetime repository-tool aggregate counters.
