# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.28.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **Semantic XML and SVG indexing**: Added native, opt-in XML element extraction and accessible SVG text extraction. SVG geometry, style, class, and layer metadata are excluded from embeddings, search and similarity results, and external reranker documents, including when a file exceeds the semantic chunk cap. Markup retrieval reconstructs the indexed semantic chunk without raw context lines and reports unavailable content when the source no longer matches.
- **Opt-in PDF text indexing**: Explicit PDF include patterns now use a shared binary-aware ingestion path across CLI, MCP, OpenCode, and Pi. Text is extracted locally into deterministic page-aware chunks, persisted for vector and keyword retrieval, retries, branch indexes, snippets, and reranking, and returned with truthful physical-page citations. Incremental updates, invalid replacements, renames, and deletions remove stale passages without blocking valid files. PDF discovery remains disabled by default; OCR and password entry are not supported.

### Changed

- **Test tooling**: Upgraded Vitest and its V8 coverage provider together to 5.0.0, keeping test and coverage tooling aligned.

### Fixed

- **PDF page preservation in search**: Evidence deduplication now distinguishes physical PDF page ranges, so passages on different pages are not collapsed merely because they share page-local line numbers or identical text. Same-page and ordinary code deduplication remain unchanged.
- **Transitive dependency security**: Updated dependency overrides for `hono` to `4.13.5` and `js-yaml` to `4.3.2`, with a lockfile-only bump of `nanoid` to `3.3.18`, addressing the current security advisories in these packages.
- **PDF definition exclusion**: Definition-oriented retrieval now excludes PDF passages before ranking and external reranking, while ordinary document search retains page-aware results.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **Cancellable and diagnosable MCP operations**: All MCP tools now support cooperative cancellation, exact-token monotone progress, and inactivity detection through `mcp.stallTimeoutMs`, which defaults to five minutes and can be disabled with `0`. Failures consistently return `isError: true` with a redacted `structuredContent.error`, while seven-day runtime records under `<indexRoot>/mcp-runtime/` are summarized by `index_status.mcpDiagnostics`. Shared indexing detaches cancelled callers without stopping work still awaited by another consumer, while exclusively owned cancelled work rolls back and releases its index lease. MCP SDK `1.29.0`, public tool names, request schemas, package identities, and index formats remain unchanged.

### Changed

- **Breaking Node.js runtime requirement**: Raised the minimum supported Node.js version from 20 to 22.13 in preparation for planned PDF text indexing. CI tests Node.js 22 and 24, with packed-package smoke checks on 22.13. Node.js 24 LTS remains recommended and is used for release packaging. The bundled `@opencode-ai/plugin` dependency is pinned to `1.3.13` to preserve the Node.js 22.13 runtime floor, while its peer compatibility range remains `^1.0.0`. PDF indexing is not included in this release.

### Fixed

- **Context retrieval quality**: Code-focused `codebase_context` searches now honor source-path prioritization, and explicit definition lookups retry without invalid directory or file-type hints before reporting a miss while remaining definition-only.
- **Swift indexing stability**: Deduplicated identical Swift chunk windows, applied deterministic last-wins chunk-ID deduplication before embedding and publication, rejected duplicate native vector-store batch keys atomically, and bumped the Swift parser cache version so existing indexes receive a one-time reparse.
- **Transitive dependency security**: Pinned `fast-uri` to 3.1.6 and `qs` to 6.16.0 through npm overrides, resolving the current URI parsing and query-string parsing Dependabot advisories in the MCP runtime dependency tree.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Source-backed architecture context**: Added the portable `architecture_context` tool across OpenCode, MCP, and Pi. It produces deterministic, token-bounded repository maps with source-derived responsibility excerpts, cited community and boundary evidence, strict query and directory focus, graph-sparse source-directory fallback, uncertainty notes, precise follow-up tool calls, and optional Git-backed recent activity. Architecture planning evaluation now measures graded evidence relevance and actual response token cost.
- **Local JavaScript module graph resolution**: TypeScript and JavaScript call edges now resolve through local relative ES module imports, aliases, default and namespace imports, named re-exports, and `export *` chains. Resolution remains conservative for ambiguous or missing modules and exports, existing indexes migrate without re-embedding unchanged chunks, and graph coverage diagnostics report branch-aware resolved and unresolved totals by language.
- **Local Go package call resolution**: Direct, unshadowed Go function calls now resolve conservatively to a unique function declared by another eligible indexed file in the same directory and package. Selector calls, build-constrained files, incompatible test files, different packages or directories, and ambiguous targets remain unresolved, while package membership and source changes refresh affected callers without re-embedding unchanged chunks.
- **Workspace package call graph resolution**: TypeScript and JavaScript call edges now follow project-local package imports selected by root `package.json` workspace array or object patterns, including exclusions, ordered static ESM `node`, `import`, and `default` conditions, exact source-facing declarations, bounded safe single-wildcard entries, and safe package-relative subpaths. Discovery remains bounded to known project sources, exact and null or invalid declarations block broader fallbacks, wildcard precedence follows Node's deterministic package-export specificity, and malformed, encoded-traversal, `node_modules`, escaping, external, or duplicate mappings remain unresolved rather than being guessed. Root ownership, manifest changes, and the resolution-version migration refresh unchanged graph edges without re-embedding source chunks.

## [0.25.1] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **MCP background worker coordination**: Concurrent MCP sessions for the same project now elect one local background worker for file watching and automatic indexing. Other sessions do not start background work and continue serving normal MCP requests, including explicit indexing operations. No daemon, installation, configuration, index-path, or storage migration is required.
- **Config exclude**: `exclude` globs now omit matching files from indexing instead of recording them as skipped and still embedding them. Directory globs such as `**/common/**` skip the tree, and incremental `/index` plus `retryFailedBatches` drop stale failed-batch retries for newly excluded paths.
- **Failed-batch retries**: Project-owned stored paths are matched against `exclude` globs after normalizing to the project root, so a hidden parent directory (for example `~/.work/project`) no longer makes valid failed batches look excluded in global scope.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Added a `dryRun` option to `index_codebase` and an `index --dry-run` CLI flag: a read-only preflight that parses the real file set and reports the exact embedding token total (files, source chunks, tokens) without requesting embeddings or writing to the index. The total serves as a fixed, monotonic denominator for live indexing progress (a force index climbs to ~100%; an incremental index tops out below 100% because cached chunks are counted but not re-embedded) and as a cost preview before committing GPU or time.
- Added query-weighted quality aggregates to cross-repository benchmark reports, alongside clearly labelled per-repository macro averages, so uneven cohort sizes cannot obscure the headline Hit@k, MRR, or nDCG results.
- Added a concise `cbi` terminal command for status, indexing, search, definition lookup, and direct caller or callee inspection, while keeping the existing MCP binary unchanged.

### Changed

- Documented optional `codebase_edit_context` guidance for Pi, MCP, and OpenCode workflows, while leaving retrieval discretionary rather than mandatory.

### Fixed

- **Definition retrieval**: Ruby classes and modules are retained in the call-graph symbol catalog so nested Ruby declarations can be resolved by definition lookup.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Added batched Ollama embedding requests through `/api/embed`, preserving fallback compatibility with servers that only expose the legacy single-text endpoint.
- Added configurable `indexing.linesPerChunk` for line-based chunking, including strict native-boundary validation and overflow-safe clamping.
- Added MCP knowledge-base management tools for all MCP clients, with matching host-specific aliases for OpenCode and Pi.
- Added inclusive `blameUntil` retrieval filters across search, peek, and find-similar tools. Temporal bounds now constrain native vector and keyword candidate retrieval using SQLite blame timestamps instead of filtering only after candidate generation.
- Added an Ollama-only representative retrieval evaluation command with expanded coverage for embedding failure recovery, index-lock recovery, and duplicate-definition path disambiguation.
- Added `--embedding-model` to the cross-repository benchmark runner, preserving `nomic-embed-text` as the default while recording the selected local Ollama model in its artifacts.
- Expanded the frozen mixed-intent cross-repository cohort to 100 reviewed queries across JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, PHP, and Ruby, with additional hard Ruby and C# cases.
- Added a deterministic pull-request CI gate that clones each pinned cohort revision and validates every evidence path plus definition symbol without invoking embeddings.

### Changed

- Pi now uses compact, adaptive repository-retrieval guidance: it recommends `codebase_context` for repository orientation rather than mechanically for every task, requests a small initial evidence pack, and avoids duplicate broad reads when that evidence is sufficient.
- Retired the unavailable `github-copilot` embedding provider with an actionable migration error. GitHub Models retired its inference API.
- Added Google `gemini-embedding-2` support with its recommended code-retrieval formatting.
- Documented local Ollama model trade-offs and reproducible Nomic, EmbeddingGemma, and Qwen 0.6B comparison results.

### Fixed

- **Interrupted indexing resume**: Interrupted indexing runs now persist incremental checkpoints (database, vectors, BM25, failed batches, and file hashes), so a subsequent run resumes incrementally instead of re-embedding the whole project. Interrupted global clears and force-indexes are completed on recovery (scoped to the current project when foreign data is present), and checkpointed failed batches and pending retries survive for later retry runs. Checkpoint persistence orders the BM25 index before the vector store so a crash between the two cannot orphan chunks from keyword search. Project-scope dead-lease recovery preserves checkpointed artifacts for incremental resume instead of resetting the local index. Pending retry chunks are no longer duplicated across multiple checkpoints, empty failed-batch state is published before new file hashes, and finalization deduplicates failed-batch records by chunk ID (keeping the highest attempt count).
- **Interrupted recovery safety**: Recovery of an interrupted global clear or clearing-phase force-index now replays the clear against the originating project scope persisted with the lease, so a project reclaiming a dead lease can no longer delete another project's indexed data. The destructive phase and effective embedding configuration are bound to the lease owner; legacy or configuration-mismatched clears fail closed and retain their recovery marker instead of applying the reclaiming project's settings. Retry runs restore SQLite chunk rows that a recovery health check may have collected as orphans, so a branch reference can never point at a chunk without metadata.
- **Forced re-embed migration safety**: While a project-scoped forced re-embed is pending, checkpoints no longer stamp new embedding metadata or a compatibility certificate, unchanged scope files are re-embedded instead of skipped, and `retryFailedBatches` only clears the pending migration after the main run has committed its new metadata. This prevents an interrupted migration from resuming into a silent mix of old and new vector spaces.
- **Pi watcher startup**: Pi now starts the filesystem watcher after a successful index initialization, so codebase changes are observed rather than silently remaining stale.
- **Indexer resilience**: Unreadable files no longer abort indexing, and invalid Pi indexing configuration is reported as a clear configuration error.
- **Definition retrieval**: Large declarations and Ruby classes or modules nested in modules are now indexed and ranked correctly for definition lookups.
- **Conceptual context retrieval**: Prefer implementation paths over tests and documentation for code-focused `codebase_context` searches, without applying a hard source-only filter or changing documentation and test queries.
- **Scoped definition lookup**: Allow explicit definition searches constrained to a file type or directory to return matching declarations in fixtures and test paths without weakening source-first ranking for ordinary searches.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **Low-descriptor native file watching**: On platforms that support it, file watching now uses one native recursive watcher and deterministic snapshot reconciliation for `add`, `change`, and `unlink` events, with automatic Chokidar fallback when native watching is unavailable.
- **Mixed-intent cross-repo benchmark pilot**: Expanded the frozen five-repository cohort from 25 exact-definition queries to 35 reviewed queries by adding keyword-heavy production retrieval coverage across JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust. The report keeps CodeGraph and codebase-memory-mcp comparison scoped to their shared 25-query exact-definition interface.
- **Mixed-intent benchmark coverage and CI gate**: Expanded the frozen cohort to 45 queries with implementation-intent and conceptual coverage, and added a no-model cross-repo benchmark contract check to pull-request CI.

### Changed

- **Serialized watcher replacement**: On OpenCode plugin reloads, the next project watcher is only created after the previous one has fully stopped, so concurrent reloads cannot leak or double-start watchers.

### Fixed

- **Large-project watcher startup**: Avoid a redundant native snapshot at startup and retain low-descriptor native project watching when a worktree configuration is inherited from outside the project, using Chokidar only for the external configuration target.
- **Watcher reconciliation correctness**: Reconcile native watcher path hints selectively, respect `indexing.maxDepth`, and retain prior entries below temporarily unreadable paths rather than emitting false `unlink` events.
- **Frozen cross-repo definition benchmark**: Reject contradictory exact-symbol targets in reviewed fixed datasets, and replace the ambiguous duplicate Express `error` query with an unambiguous `GithubView` lookup.
- **Source-intent keyword retrieval**: Recognize Go, Rust, and Python test filenames and retain a wider candidate pool for identifier-rich source queries, so related test assertions do not displace production evidence before reranking.
- **MCP server clean shutdown**: `opencode-codebase-index-mcp` now terminates its file watcher, auto-index coordination, and stdio transport on stdin EOF, protocol close, or `SIGHUP`/`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, exiting 0 instead of leaving persistent watcher processes and file descriptors behind after the host disappears.

## [0.22.5] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **codebase-memory-mcp comparator**: Added an opt-in, fixed-version fair comparator to the cross-repository benchmark runner. It uses repeat-local source copies and cache state, retains raw artifacts, and disqualifies malformed or unsafe results rather than scoring them as misses.
- **Expanded cross-repo benchmark pilot**: Added a frozen 25-query definition cohort across JavaScript, Python, Go, and Rust, plus reproducible three-way results for the plugin, CodeGraph, and codebase-memory-mcp.

### Fixed

- **Frozen benchmark inputs**: `cross-repo-benchmark --dataset-dir` now requires a validated dataset for every requested repository instead of silently mixing reviewed inputs with generated candidates.
- **Exact definition ranking**: Prefer same-module results for duplicate exact definition names while preserving explicit file hints and exact-match safety.
- **Cross-repository comparator isolation**: Exclude existing `.opencode` data from comparator source copies and tolerate codebase-memory-mcp file-level results that omit source lines without accepting unusable paths.

## [0.22.4] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Context diagnostics**: `codebase_context` now supports an optional `diagnostic` flag across MCP, OpenCode, and Pi. It exposes bounded routing, retrieval, and evidence-pack traces for troubleshooting without changing normal text output.
- **Pre-edit context**: Added the portable `codebase_edit_context` tool for gathering bounded, edit-oriented repository evidence across MCP, OpenCode, and Pi.
- **Pre-edit evaluation gate**: `codebase_edit_context` now has a documented CI evaluation gate. The budget gate supports a `minGraphNeighborRecall` threshold, and `npm run eval:pre-edit:ci` runs the deterministic mock-embedding baseline (Hit@5 1.0, MRR@10 1.0, graph-neighbor recall 1.0) with thresholds in `benchmarks/budgets/pre-edit.json`. The golden dataset covers a resolvable caller lookup, a target-only lookup, and an unresolved-symbol fallback that must route to the conceptual search pack.
- **Fair CodeGraph comparator**: Added a documented cross-repository benchmark harness and public comparison matrix for normalized CodeGraph retrieval measurements.

### Fixed

- **GitHub Actions runtime**: Updated the CI path-semantics job to Node 24-compatible `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` releases, removing the deprecated Node 20 action-runtime warning.

- **Community detection performance**: Avoid cloning adjacency sets on every label-propagation pass, keeping the 10k-node community and coupling workload within its CI performance budget.

- **Package metadata staging**: Exclude local indexes, benchmark results, and other generated workspace artifacts from staged package copies, preventing release-validation timeouts and accidental inclusion of local data.

- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Bumped transitive dependency pins to patched releases so `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities: `hono` 4.12.34 (CORS ReDoS), `ip-address` 10.4.0 (SSRF and trust-boundary bypasses), `fast-uri` 3.1.5 (host confusion), `postcss` 8.5.26 (source-map disclosure), `undici` 8.9.0 via `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.84.0 (CRLF injection, cache parsing, cookie and retry issues), `brace-expansion` 5.0.9 (DoS), and `@eslint/config-array` 0.23.5 (minimatch-based DoS path).

- **JS-YAML vulnerability**: Pinned transitive `js-yaml` to 4.3.1 to remediate CVE-2026-59870 quadratic CPU consumption in `!!omap` resolution.

- **Pre-edit fallback quality gates**: Added optional `minRouteAccuracy` and `minOutcomeAccuracy` evaluation budget thresholds and applied them in `benchmarks/budgets/pre-edit.json` so unresolved `expectedRoute`/`expectedOutcome` assertions now gate CI.

- **Cross-repo comparison latency**: Omit non-comparable CodeGraph CLI startup time from fair quality tables while retaining raw timing artifacts for diagnostics.
- **Cross-repo comparison eligibility**: Exclude documentation-only symbols from the CodeGraph exact-definition cohort, keeping the comparator aligned to source-intent definition retrieval.
- **Exact definition context**: Preserve exact definition lookup ordering when assembling `codebase_context` evidence, so diversification cannot displace the requested definition.

## [0.22.3] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- **Canonical identity cleanup**: Standardized remaining user-facing defaults and development example copy to prefer `open-codebase-index` in docs and build artifacts, including architecture, contributor and troubleshooting guidance, native crate description, benchmark defaults, and host-neutral bundle banners. Legacy package, binary, manifest, storage, and dual-publication compatibility remains unchanged.

### Fixed

- **CI timing reliability**: Added explicit Git watcher readiness, replaced watcher startup sleeps with readiness synchronization, stopped forcing polling in config-refresh integration tests, retried file writes only when an event was not observed, and changed the 10k-node community performance gate to enforce a sub-second warm median plus a two-second cold/outlier ceiling.

## [0.22.2] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- **Repository rename preparation**: Added validated repository URL overrides for staged package and host metadata, including package, Claude, and Codex repository fields, and made release metadata follow `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` before and after the planned GitHub rename.
- **Canonical repository identity**: Renamed the GitHub repository to `Helweg/open-codebase-index` and updated package metadata, host manifests, badges, installation commands, security links, troubleshooting links, and changelog comparisons while preserving legacy package, binary, storage, and tool compatibility.

## [0.22.1] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- **Two-tier retrieval quality gates**: Added a daily focused Ollama smoke evaluation and a weekly full-repository representative evaluation spanning TypeScript, Rust, Swift, and PHP, with manual tier selection, separate artifacts, and dataset-specific absolute budgets.

### Changed

- **Faster real-provider evaluation**: Scoped the four-query scheduled Ollama smoke gate to the relevant indexer, OpenCode adapter, and configuration source areas, retaining real semantic competition and all expected files while avoiding full-repository embedding on CPU-only GitHub runners.

### Fixed

- **Evaluation quality gate**: Replaced the retired GitHub Models fallback with a pinned local Ollama provider, refreshed stale smoke-dataset paths after the adapter and ranking refactors, explicitly scoped scheduled runs to the smoke dataset, and fail fast when CI reindexing produces no searchable vectors instead of reporting a misleading zero-quality score.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- **Direct index CLI subcommand for MCP binary**: Added an `index` command to the shared MCP CLI entrypoint with `--project`, `--host`, `--config`, `--force`, `--estimate-only`, and `--verbose` options. The command shares indexing execution and lock handling with existing flows, writes diagnostics to `stderr`, fails on usage and runtime errors, and keeps MCP/eval/visualize modes intact.
- **Portable `code_communities` tool**: Added a graph-analysis tool across OpenCode, MCP, and Pi to expose call-graph communities and hub symbols. It performs label-propagation clustering, reports deterministic member summaries, and identifies hubs using distinct cross-community neighbors. It supports `branch`, `minSize`, `limit`, and `hubThreshold` and recomputes on demand from branch-local data.
- **Community coupling options for `code_communities`**: Added parity support for `minCoupling` and `couplingLimit` across OpenCode, MCP, and Pi, including representative coupling rendering and expanded host-parity test coverage.
- **Community-aware retrieval ranking**: Added deterministic, opt-in ranking that boosts exact symbol matches within the same in-scope call-graph community. The feature is branch-aware, disabled by default, and falls back to existing ranking when graph context is unavailable.

### Changed

- **Bounded file-level indexing batches** (#224): Changed-file scans now store only path, hash, and byte size before parsing and chunking. Embedding, call-graph extraction, and storage are processed in bounded batches with queue backpressure. Failed embeddings are persisted as versioned JSONL and retried from a bounded stream while preserving legacy JSON-array reads, branch catalogs, Git blame, duplicate-embedding reuse, and index visibility after interrupted runs.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **Host-neutral package identity**: Published `open-codebase-index` as the preferred package with both `open-codebase-index-mcp` and `opencode-codebase-index-mcp` binaries. The existing `opencode-codebase-index` package remains fully supported and is published from the same implementation.
- **Safe rename roadmap**: Documented the staged package, repository, compatibility, deprecation, storage, native-artifact, validation, and rollback plan for the transition to `open-codebase-index`.

### Changed

- **Host-neutral adapter architecture**: Isolated OpenCode, MCP, and Pi registration behind dedicated adapters, moved MCP CLI runtime behind its adapter, centralized portable tool-name contracts, and require explicit host context wherever runtime paths or behavior differ. Tool names, schemas, outputs, and host-specific aliases remain unchanged.
- **Portable project indexes across Git worktrees**: Project-owned paths are now persisted relative to the project root. Worktrees that inherit project configuration share the main checkout's index and reuse unchanged chunks and embeddings, while an explicit worktree-local project config keeps its index isolated. Existing project indexes with absolute stored paths require a one-time force rebuild.
- **Compatibility-aware release pipeline**: Package metadata and host manifests are staged per package identity, native artifacts remain stable, new installation examples prefer `open-codebase-index`, and release retries skip package versions already published.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- **Maintainable internal boundaries**: Split the TypeScript native facade, search and definition ranking, embedding batches, tool adapters and runtime, context packing and recovery, Git branch resolution, native Database bindings, and SQLite call-graph persistence into focused modules while preserving existing public APIs and behavior.
- **Focused documentation**: Reorganized the README into a concise entry point with dedicated installation, configuration, and tool-reference guides, and refreshed architecture, contribution, troubleshooting, and language-support documentation to match the current source tree.

### Fixed

- **Stable filesystem path identities** (#178): Canonicalize physical, symlinked, missing-descendant, case-insensitive, and Unicode-equivalent paths before comparing project ownership and index state, preventing duplicate identities and incomplete cleanup across equivalent checkout paths. Added cross-platform path-semantics CI coverage and bundled the pinned Unicode case-folding dependency with its license notice.
- **Watcher file-descriptor exhaustion** (#179): Fall back once from native file watching to polling after `EMFILE`, while preserving readiness, pending changes, restart behavior, asynchronous shutdown, and the native-watcher default.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **Battery-aware background indexing**: Added the opt-in `indexing.pauseBackgroundIndexingOnBattery` setting. On macOS, automatic startup and watcher-triggered indexing now waits for AC power, coalesces pending work into one update, and keeps manual `index_codebase` requests available. Power detection uses a five-second `pmset` timeout and fails open if the source cannot be determined.
- **Actionable effectiveness diagnostics**: Privacy-safe runtime metrics now include bounded per-route outcome, result-count, latency, and returned-token histograms. Scheduled quality evaluations retain public synthetic summary and per-query artifacts for 14 days, including failed runs.
- **Representative retrieval evaluation**: Added a versioned hand-labeled benchmark spanning TypeScript, Rust, Swift, and PHP with difficulty and intent axes, scoped filters, recovery expectations, strict negative cases, symbol-aware graded evidence, and per-query route, outcome, and recovery diagnostics.

### Changed

- **Maintained GitHub Actions runtime**: Updated JavaScript-based workflow actions to immutable Node.js 24 releases, including Release Drafter, checkout, artifact, setup, and script actions.
- **Broader agent routing hints** (#158): Common repository tasks such as fixing bugs, adding support, investigating failures, refactoring, and reviewing code now receive lightweight `codebase_context`-first guidance. Each matching user message emits the hint at most once, preventing repeated token overhead during tool-call loops. Exact identifier, direct-path, external, and unrelated operational requests remain unnudged.
- **Stronger retrieval quality gate**: The GitHub Models scheduled evaluation now requires at least 75% Hit@5 and 0.65 MRR@10, so the gate catches material retrieval regressions that the previous permissive floor allowed.
- **Source-aware context packs**: Conceptual agent context now prioritizes implementation files over documentation, tests, and fixtures unless the query explicitly asks for those paths, while preserving the underlying retrieval order within each evidence class.

### Fixed

- **Development dependency advisories**: Updated the pinned PostCSS and brace-expansion transitive dependencies to patched releases.
- **Exact definitions in large files**: Definition and implementation searches now rescue branch-scoped symbols from the uncapped symbol catalog when per-file embedding limits omit their semantic chunks, restoring exact lookup without increasing embedding volume.
- **Nested method definitions**: Symbol catalogs now recursively extract nested declarations independently of capped semantic chunks, migrate unchanged indexes without re-embedding content, and restore exact method lookup in large classes.
- **Evaluation artifact uploads**: Scheduled quality diagnostics now use a visible output directory so GitHub Actions uploads the generated summaries and per-query evidence on both successful and failed runs.
- **Silent branch switching by default** (#189): Branch changes no longer print directly to stdout. Opt-in branch diagnostics are recorded through the configured debug logger and remain available through `index_logs` when both `debug.enabled` and `debug.logBranch` are enabled.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Plugin startup smoke coverage**: Added a bounded subprocess harness for empty, runtime-state-only, and package-marked non-git projects. It runs within the existing CI test job without additional native builds.

### Changed

- **Safer project marker detection**: Runtime-generated `.opencode` and `.codebase-index` directories no longer qualify as project markers, so they cannot enable background watching or indexing in otherwise empty directories.

### Fixed

- **OpenCode startup root handling** (#184): When selecting the OpenCode plugin root, prefer `worktree` only if it is a real Git repository. Non-git worktree values now correctly fall back to `directory` to avoid accidental indexing and watching from filesystem roots.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Reliable opt-in MCP auto-indexing**: Added a process-scoped coordinator shared by Jcode, Codex, Claude, OpenCode, Pi, manual indexing, and file watchers. It tracks sanitized lifecycle/progress timestamps, skips healthy current indexes, coalesces concurrent work, bounds exponential lock retries and first-retrieval waits, refreshes stale indexes with the latest Indexer, and cancels retry work during shutdown while preserving multiprocess locks and home/project-marker safety. `autoIndex` remains `false` by default so retrieval never triggers paid embedding work without explicit opt-in.
- **Privacy-safe effectiveness metrics**: Added independent top-level opt-in, process-lifetime memory-only, schema-versioned fixed counters and histograms for repository tool routes, hosts, outcomes, recovery, result counts, latency, token budgets, returned-token estimates, exact-search handoffs, and scope relaxation across OpenCode, MCP, and Pi. The process-wide collector survives Indexer and config-watcher refreshes without repository or user identity dimensions, supports explicit reset, and has adversarial privacy, saturation, disabled-overhead, final-response, and error-path coverage.
- **Offline effectiveness evaluation**: Added deterministic synthetic fixtures and a no-network formatting report with equal `maxResults` and final-response token budgets across routes. Evidence is credited only when visible in returned text, and the oracle exact-search baseline emits only matching lines without arbitrary complete reads. The report states that fixed rankings and markers do not measure retrieval quality, latency, end-to-end agent success, causal impact, or production performance.
- **Intent-aware ranking evaluation**: Added a transparent fixed-candidate baseline comparison for evidence recall@3 and MRR across exact and Unicode-normalized definitions, test/docs/config/call-flow queries, duplicate evidence, file diversity, and a conceptual-search guardrail.

### Changed

- **Exact-search handoffs**: Metadata-only semantic discovery and conceptual context packs now return bounded, result-derived symbol suggestions for exact usage or exhaustive-match searches, with handoffs included in context token-budget accounting across OpenCode, MCP, and Pi.
- **Automatic branch and PR index preparation**: `pr_impact` now safely materializes and indexes missing branch or pull-request commits in isolated hook-disabled worktrees, verifies commit-aware fork-specific catalogs, and reuses or replaces indexes without changing the caller's worktree.
- **Global knowledge-base reuse**: Global indexes now reuse identical knowledge-base chunks across projects instead of re-embedding them for each project catalog, while keeping project-owned source chunks isolated.
- **Name-based call graph routing**: Callers, callees, and dependency paths now resolve unique symbol names automatically across native OpenCode, MCP, Pi, and `codebase_context`. Duplicate names return bounded candidate locations with optional file-path disambiguators, while `symbolId` remains an optional compatibility escape hatch.
- **Self-recovering context lookup**: `codebase_context` now retries empty scoped searches without file filters, retries inferred symbol text after definition-style misses, reports bounded recovery metadata, and keeps all fallback responses within the requested token budget across MCP, native OpenCode, Pi, and evaluation.
- **Intent-aware local ranking**: Semantic and hybrid search now strongly promote exact NFKC/case-normalized authoritative definitions, interpret definition/implementation/test/docs/config/call-flow wording, demote imports, wrappers, fixtures, generated/vendor copies unless requested, remove nested duplicate chunks, diversify useful files, preserve conceptual retrieval strength, and keep stable ties.
- **Scoped external reranking**: Directory, file-type, chunk-type, and blame filters now run before external reranking. Only already-scoped candidates and their exact indexed line ranges can be sent, while intent classification and evidence-class ordering remain deterministic and local.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **CommonJS package import**: Bundle the ESM-only OpenCode plugin dependency into CommonJS artifacts so the advertised `require("opencode-codebase-index")` entry point works in clean installations, and regression-test both published module formats during every TypeScript build.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **Ollama model discovery**: Added support for arbitrary local embedding models by reading their capabilities, dimensions, and context length from the Ollama API at runtime.
- **Swift language support**: Added Tree-sitter semantic parsing, nested symbols, source ranges, and case-sensitive call graph extraction for Swift.
- **PHP 8.x coverage**: Expanded semantic chunking and call graph regression coverage for PHP 8.0 through supported PHP 8.5 syntax, and updated `tree-sitter-php` to 0.24.2.
- **C and C++ call graphs**: Added Tree-sitter extraction for direct, member, and qualified calls, constructors, includes, and namespace imports.
- **Metal Shading Language**: Added default `.metal` discovery, semantic chunks for Metal declarations, and direct, template, member, and qualified call extraction.

### Fixed

- **Language-aware call graph lookup**: Preserve case-sensitive caller and path queries for Swift, C, C++, Metal, and other case-sensitive languages while retaining case-insensitive matching for PHP and Apex.
- **Ollama upgrade safety**: Keep built-in `:latest` model names compatible with existing indexes, bound embedding requests with a timeout, and reject malformed or dimensionally invalid vectors.
- **PHP call graph resolution**: Resolve same-file PHP function and constructor calls case-insensitively, disambiguate function and class name collisions by call type, and refresh cached PHP call edges after resolution upgrades.
- **Git worktree index isolation**: Keep project indexes local to each worktree while continuing to inherit project configuration from the main checkout, preventing cross-worktree index mutations and stale absolute paths.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- **Published MCP CLI startup**: Keep `tiktoken` external to the ESM bundle so the installed `opencode-codebase-index-mcp` executable no longer crashes with `__dirname is not defined`; every TypeScript build now smoke-tests the built ESM CLI.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- **Agent-facing retrieval evaluation**: Added a versioned `codebase_context` golden dataset, `npm run eval:agent`, and per-query route metadata for measuring definition routing and conceptual discovery.
- **Token-budgeted context packs**: Added deterministic overlapping-result deduplication and cross-file evidence selection with configurable 128-4000 token response budgets across native OpenCode, MCP, and Pi clients.
- **Context efficiency gates**: Added returned-token, duplicate-candidate, file-diversity, and quality-per-1,000-token evaluation metrics with configurable CI thresholds.

### Changed

- **Automatic definition routing**: `codebase_context` now conservatively infers unambiguous symbol names from definition-style questions before falling back to conceptual search, using shared routing across native OpenCode, MCP, Pi, and evaluation.
- **Large-file retrieval coverage**: Files exceeding `maxChunksPerFile` now retain representative chunks from across the file instead of silently indexing only the beginning.
- **Location-first context details**: Definition and conceptual routes now return compact locations rather than full source bodies, deduplicate overlapping evidence, diversify results across files, and report why candidates were omitted.
- **Hard token caps**: Context budgets are enforced with the `cl100k_base` tokenizer, including Unicode-safe compaction, so agent harnesses can bound retrieval responses before requesting exact source.

### Fixed

- **Concurrent lock recovery**: Hardened crashed-owner index lock reclamation so concurrent recovery attempts publish a single valid lock without losing the winning candidate.
- **Packed-context edge cases**: Preserve valid Unicode and report zero selected results when even one evidence item cannot fit the requested token budget.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Unified agent context gateway**: Added the `codebase_context` MCP and Pi tool as the preferred first step for repository questions, routing conceptual discovery, authoritative symbol definitions, and call-graph paths through one low-friction interface.
- **Cross-client tool adoption**: Added native Codex session guidance, skill/default-prompt updates, and Pi pre-agent routing guidance so Jcode, OpenCode, Codex, and Pi agents select codebase tools before broad shell search or file reads.

### Changed

- **Self-routing MCP guidance**: Reworked server instructions and tool descriptions around a staged, client-neutral workflow: check readiness, retrieve lightweight context, locate definitions or graph paths, then use full-content search or exact grep only when needed.
- **Client plugin metadata**: Aligned Codex and Claude Code marketplace manifests with the package release version so clients can discover and refresh the updated integration guidance.

### Fixed

- **Jcode MCP argument compatibility**: Treat explicit JSON `null` values for optional MCP arguments as omitted values across search, definition, graph, PR-impact, and index tools.
- **Embedding-provider outages**: Keep `codebase_search` and `codebase_peek` operational through BM25 keyword fallback when query embedding generation is temporarily unavailable, with full keyword weighting and actionable diagnostics.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **First-class Jcode integration**: Added the `jcode` MCP host mode, neutral `.codebase-index/` storage, legacy OpenCode state fallback, automated host-path coverage, and global multi-repository setup guidance for Jcode v0.56.0 and newer.

### Changed

- **Node.js runtime requirement**: Raised the supported Node.js version from 18 to 20 to use patched runtime dependencies.

### Fixed

- **Multiprocess index safety**: Serialized index mutations across processes with canonical-path leases, kept cold readers non-mutating, hardened atomic vector and BM25 publication, and added recovery for incomplete or crashed publications.
- **Parser-backed source discovery**: Added `.mts`, `.cts`, `.cxx`, `.hxx`, and `.cs` to the default include patterns.

### Security

- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Updated vulnerable runtime and development dependency chains, including Hono, `@hono/node-server`, `body-parser`, `fast-uri`, `brace-expansion`, `js-yaml`, and Pi's shrinkwrapped dependencies. `npm audit` now reports zero vulnerabilities.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Bash call graph support**: Added tree-sitter call extraction for Bash scripts so shell functions and invocations participate in call graph indexing.
- **Git blame metadata**: Added git blame details to indexed chunks so search results can include authorship and recency context.

### Fixed

- **Pi call graph output**: Aligned Pi call graph formatting with the host adapters.
- **Bash parser linting**: Resolved Rust clippy warnings in the Bash parser merge guard.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- **Local plugin development**: Added `npm run dev:link-mcp` so this repository checkout can provide the local `opencode-codebase-index-mcp` bin expected by the standard `npx --package opencode-codebase-index ...` MCP command, without changing the published Codex/Claude manifests.
- **MCP install docs**: Updated MCP examples to use the published-package `npx -y --package opencode-codebase-index opencode-codebase-index-mcp ...` form and clarified that MCP runtime dependencies ship with the package.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **Codex and Claude MCP startup**: Recognize npm `.bin` symlink launches as the CLI entrypoint so `npx --package opencode-codebase-index opencode-codebase-index-mcp --host ...` starts the MCP server instead of exiting before handshake.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Temporal call graph visualization**: Added the `index_visualize` tool, `/visualize` slash command, and `npm run visualize` CLI shortcut for generating a self-contained browser HTML view of recent change lenses, module topology, symbol exploration, hotspots, and cycles (#120).
- **First-class Codex integration**: Added Codex plugin marketplace metadata, skill guidance, session hook guidance, and an MCP manifest so Codex can install and run the package as a plugin (#121).
- **First-class Claude Code integration**: Added Claude Code plugin metadata, inline MCP server configuration, and host-specific installation documentation so Claude Code sessions can use the same MCP tools and skill guidance (#139).
- **First-class Pi integration**: Added a Pi extension and package metadata exposing semantic search, indexing, call graph, PR impact, and knowledge-base tools through Pi's native tool interface (#139).
- **Host-native storage paths**: Added Codex/Pi neutral `.codebase-index/` paths and Claude Code `.claude/` paths, with fallback to legacy OpenCode state when host-native state is absent.

### Fixed

- **Codex marketplace install**: Run the Codex MCP server through the published npm CLI via `npx` so git marketplace installs no longer depend on gitignored local `dist/` artifacts (#140).
- **Claude marketplace install**: Run the Claude Code MCP server through the published npm CLI via `npx` so git plugin installs no longer depend on gitignored local `dist/` artifacts.
- **Watcher reindexing**: Run file-watch reindexing in the background while keeping reindex jobs serialized, avoiding blocking watcher callbacks without allowing unsafe concurrent rebuilds.
- **Codex legacy rebuilds**: Preserve legacy local force rebuild behavior for Codex host mode.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **PR impact analysis**: Added the `pr_impact` tool, `/pr-impact` slash command, and native call-graph reachability/community analysis so PRs can be ranked by affected symbols, hub nodes, and optional concurrent-PR conflicts (#128).
- **Opt-in OMO CodeGraph routing hints**: Added `search.routingGraphHandoffHints` plus command routing updates so conceptual discovery can hand off to graph/path tools after semantic lookup identifies the right symbols (#130).

### Fixed
- **Exported TS/JS symbol indexing**: Restored call-graph symbol persistence for exported declarations so `call_graph`, `call_graph_path`, and `pr_impact` work correctly on fresh indexes (#132).

### Security
- **Dependency hardening**: Bumped `js-yaml` to 4.2.0 and the transitive `hono` override to 4.12.25 to close shipped dependency vulnerabilities (#127, #131).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- Shortest-path queries between symbols in call graph (`e5f9046`).
- Extract inheritance and implements relationships in call graph (#118, `b12ff6b`).
- Confidence metadata on call graph edges (`af29b8a`).

### Changed
- Apply rustfmt formatting fixes in `db.rs` (`26e0d2b`).

### Fixed
- Reject ambiguous source/target names in path queries (`a30a09c`).
- Prevent fabricated paths through ambiguous intermediate edges (`1102072`).
- Avoid ambiguous target resolution in BFS path queries (`12f1d19`).
- Resolve clippy lints in BFS path reconstruction and Rust code (`ab2e325`, `933ddf1`).
- Restore `@opencode-ai/plugin` version pin (`ca0fdee`).

### Security
- Bump `vite` 8.0.16 / `esbuild` 0.28.1 overrides (`20a10c4`).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Developer role for routing hints**: Support `developer` role for routing hint messages via `search.routingHintRole` config option (#102).

### Fixed
- **Multi-project index collision**: Resolved index collisions when multiple projects are open by using per-directory Indexer map keyed by worktree root (#108).
- **Watcher EPERM flood**: Prevent watcher from recursing into OS-restricted directories that cause permission error storms (#109).
- **CodeQL security findings**: Fully break taint chains from `apiKey` to error logs and resolve 6 GitHub CodeQL security findings (#105).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- **GDScript language support**: Added tree-sitter semantic parsing, file discovery (`.gd`), and call-graph extraction for GDScript (#94).
- **MATLAB indexing support**: Added tree-sitter semantic parsing and file discovery for MATLAB (`.m`). MATLAB is opt-in via `additionalInclude` because `.m` conflicts with Objective-C on Apple codebases (#91).
- **MATLAB call graph support**: Added query-based call extraction for MATLAB direct function calls and dotted method/package calls, enabled `.m` files in the `call_graph` indexing path, and documented the MATLAB indexing/function-call ambiguity in tests (#91).

### Changed
- **Subsystem module splits**: Split large config, embeddings, eval, MCP, watcher, git, tools, routing, and utility modules into smaller focused files while preserving public entrypoints (#92).
- **AI slop removal**: Trimmed redundant comments and small wrapper noise across config, eval, runtime, indexer, tools, and utils with behavior-neutral refactors (#93).
- **Remove SiliconFlow default**: The custom reranker no longer falls back to a Chinese endpoint (`api.siliconflow.cn`). A `baseUrl` is now required for the `custom` reranker provider. README examples updated to use Cohere and generic env-var placeholders.

### Fixed
- **SSRF protection for custom embedding provider**: Custom provider URLs are now validated against cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.x.x, metadata.google.internal) and non-HTTP protocols to prevent server-side request forgery via malicious config files.
- **Knowledge base path restrictions**: `add_knowledge_base` now blocks sensitive system directories (`/etc`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/boot`, `/root`, `/var/run`, `/var/log`) and home dotdirs (`.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.config/gcloud`, `.docker`, `.kube`). Symlinks are resolved before checking.
- **Google API key moved to header**: The Google embedding provider now sends the API key via the `x-goog-api-key` header instead of a URL query parameter, preventing credential exposure in logs and proxies.
- **Error response truncation**: All embedding providers now truncate error response bodies to 500 characters, preventing reflection of potentially sensitive data from misconfigured or malicious endpoints.
- **Config and eval loading hardening**: File-specific parse/shape errors, knowledge-base/include path rebasing fixes, and malformed eval summary coverage (#92).
- **Command and indexer diagnostics**: Surface command file read failures and warn-level cache recovery details for corrupted persisted state (#92).
- **`additionalInclude` dedup filter removal**: User-supplied globs that matched default include patterns were silently stripped; the filter is now removed so `additionalInclude` correctly extends defaults (#91).
- **npm audit vulnerabilities**: Remediated vulnerable transitive dependencies (#99).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-22

### Changed
- **Release metadata alignment**: Reconciled the post-`v0.8.0` shipped delta so the changelog and release metadata match the fixes that landed after the `v0.8.0` tag.

### Fixed
- **Atomic file-hash cache writes**: `Indexer.atomicWriteSync()` now recreates missing parent directories before writing `file-hashes.json.tmp`, preventing `ENOENT` crashes after the index directory has been removed.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Git worktree fallback and reuse**: Fresh git worktrees now inherit the main repository's project-scoped `.opencode` config and index when no local worktree state exists, including matching eval-path and knowledge-base handling.
- **Apex semantic parsing**: Added tree-sitter-based semantic chunking for Salesforce Apex source files (`.cls` and `.trigger`) via the [`tree-sitter-sfapex`](https://github.com/aheber/tree-sitter-sfapex) grammar. Recognizes class, interface, enum, method, constructor, and trigger declarations with leading JavaDoc-style block comments attached to their target chunks. Anonymous Apex (`.apex`), SOQL, and SOSL standalone files are out of scope.
- **Apex call graph extraction**: Method invocations, constructor calls (`new MyClass(...)`), and instance/static method calls are extracted for the `call_graph` tool. Apex is case-insensitive at the language level, so callee names are normalized to lowercase during extraction (matching the existing PHP behavior). Apex has no imports — namespaces are referenced via fully qualified names — so no `Import` edges are produced.
- **Zig language support**: Added tree-sitter semantic parsing, file discovery, and call-graph extraction for `.zig` files.
- **New slash commands**: Added `/peek` for lightweight location-first discovery and `/reindex` as a full rebuild shortcut.

### Changed
- **Ollama oversized-input handling**: Built-in Ollama embeddings now use pooled multi-part requests, broader context-length detection, and progressive retry/backoff behavior for oversized inputs.
- **Release documentation and support guidance**: Aligned maintainer guidance, support policy, and release workflow docs with the protected-branch release process used for `v0.8.0`.

### Fixed
- **Index reset and cleanup hardening**: Fixed shared/global rebuild flows, SQLite corruption recovery, stale chunk ownership cleanup, and related rebuild-state edge cases across project and worktree setups.
- **Windows build and test reliability**: Fixed Windows-native build/test failures with explicit database/indexer cleanup, portable path handling, and cross-platform native pretest scripting.
- **Database close lifecycle**: Hardened `Database.close()` so use-after-close fails fast instead of silently swapping to an in-memory SQLite connection.
- **Semantic search and rebuild cleanup**: Restored identifier fallback in semantic search and rebuilt cleanup paths from SQLite-backed state without relying on unsafe native remove flows.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Knowledge base support**: Added `add_knowledge_base`, `list_knowledge_bases`, and `remove_knowledge_base` tools to manage external document folders indexed alongside the project
- **Reranking with SiliconFlow**: Added `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` reranking support via SiliconFlow API for improved search result quality
- **Routing hints for local discovery**: Added dynamic routing hints so local search can steer retrieval toward more relevant code paths before semantic reranking
- **TXT/HTML file support**: Added `*.txt`, `*.html`, `*.htm` to default include patterns for document indexing
- **Config merging**: Global and project configs are now merged, allowing shared provider settings at global level and knowledge base paths at project level
- **Hidden file exclusion**: Files and folders starting with `.` are now excluded from indexing and file watching
- **Build folder exclusion**: Folders containing "build" in their name (e.g., `build`, `mingwBuildDebug`) are now excluded from indexing and file watching
- **additionalInclude config**: Added new config option to extend default file patterns without replacing them
- **Eval diversity quality gates**: Added raw and distinct top-k diversity metrics, budgets, and regression coverage for eval runs and reranker benchmarking

### Changed
- **Default verbose=false**: Changed `/index` command default to `verbose=false` to reduce token consumption
- **Dependency hardening**: Added targeted npm overrides and refreshed lockfile resolution to keep vulnerable transitive packages patched in release builds

### Fixed
- **Knowledge base refresh behavior**: Adding or removing knowledge bases now rebuilds the shared in-memory indexer immediately instead of requiring a restart
- **Watcher-triggered reindexing**: Restored automatic reindexing on file changes so watched projects and attached knowledge bases stay current during a live session
- **Parser and call-graph stability**: Fixed recursion-limit and segmentation-fault regressions, removed unsupported parent traversal paths, and improved PHP method-call extraction reliability
- **Plugin/runtime packaging**: Kept `@opencode-ai/plugin` available at runtime by shipping it as a dependency instead of relying on dev-only installation
- **Eval workflow rate limiting**: Throttled GitHub Models quality runs to avoid rate-limit failures in the release verification pipeline

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Custom provider batch caps**: Added `customProvider.maxBatchSize` / `max_batch_size` support so OpenAI-compatible embedding servers can cap inputs per `/embeddings` request
- **Environment placeholders in config**: Added `{env:VAR_NAME}` placeholder support for string config values so secrets and endpoints can be supplied from the environment instead of committed files

### Changed
- **Release documentation alignment**: Updated release metadata to publish the post-`v0.6.0` config improvements as `v0.6.1`

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Evaluation harness**: First-class eval CLI, golden datasets, budgets, compare mode, run artifacts, and smoke/quality workflows for measuring retrieval quality over time
- **Implementation lookup workflow**: Added a dedicated definition/implementation retrieval path across the CLI, plugin tools, MCP server, indexer, and tests for faster code lookup by intent
- **Cross-repo benchmarking**: Added a benchmark runner with ripgrep and ast-grep baselines plus reproducible benchmarking documentation and golden datasets for external repos
- **Release automation guardrails**: Added Release Drafter automation and CI enforcement for release-category and semver labels on pull requests
- **Contributor language-support guide**: Added an agent-ready guide for extending semantic parsing and call-graph support to new languages
- **PHP language support**: Added semantic parsing, chunking, and call-graph extraction for PHP, including fixtures and tests for constructors, imports, method calls, and simple calls

### Changed
- **Evaluation CI strategy**: Split the default GitHub Models quality gate from explicit external-provider budget checks and documented the active CI budget paths
- **Documentation refresh**: Reorganized contributor and maintenance docs, expanded evaluation and benchmarking guidance, and updated README benchmark snapshots and workflow references

### Fixed
- **Release Drafter permissions**: Restored draft-release updates so release automation can keep draft notes current
- **Eval/CI correctness**: Closed CI gating gaps, normalized baseline paths, and pinned the Rust toolchain action input used by CI
- **Benchmark auditability**: Fixed scoped ast-grep metric accounting and dataset/result mutability issues in the benchmark runner and reporting flow
- **Supply-chain hardening**: Tightened dependency and repository security posture, including stronger git/worktree handling coverage in tests
- **Native test reliability**: `test:run` and `test:coverage` now rebuild the native module first so newly added parser/call-graph language support is exercised against a current binary during release verification

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Call graph extraction and query**: Tree-sitter query-based extraction of function calls, method calls, constructors, and imports across 5 languages (TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust)
- **`call_graph` tool**: Query callers or callees of any function/method with branch-aware filtering
- **DB schema v2**: `symbols`, `call_edges`, and `branch_symbols` tables with full CRUD, GC, and batch operations
- **Same-file call resolution**: Automatically resolves call edges to symbols defined in the same file during indexing
- **`/call-graph` slash command**: Added command support for call graph workflows

### Changed
- **Documentation updates**: Expanded README, CHANGELOG, and skill guide to document call graph usage and behavior

### Fixed
- **Missing `call_graph` export**: The `call_graph` tool was not exported from the plugin entry point — now available to OpenCode users
- **JavaScript call extraction routing**: JavaScript now uses a dedicated query file instead of TypeScript query routing
- **Caller output context**: Caller results now include caller symbol/file context for clearer navigation
- **Call graph consistency/integrity**: Improved branch filtering and database integrity handling for call graph data

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Custom embedding provider**: Support for any OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint (`custom` provider with `baseUrl`, `model`, `dimensions` config). Works with llama.cpp, vLLM, text-embeddings-inference, LiteLLM, etc.

### Fixed
- **Critical: infinite recursion on stale lock file**: When a stale `indexing.lock` existed from a crashed session, `initialize()` entered infinite recursion via `recoverFromInterruptedIndexing()` → `healthCheck()` → `ensureInitialized()` → `initialize()`, causing 70GB+ memory usage and OOM. Recovery now runs after store/database initialization.
- **Relative path storage**: Index now stores relative paths for project portability. Detects and warns about legacy absolute-path indexes.
- **MCP status prompt**: Removed empty args schema from status prompt that caused validation errors

### Changed
- **Changelog and README**: Fixed bullet formatting, added platform support table

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **MCP server**: Standalone MCP server (`opencode-codebase-index-mcp` CLI) exposing all 8 tools and 4 prompts over stdio transport, enabling integration with Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf
- **Crash-safe indexing**: Lock file and atomic writes prevent index corruption from interrupted indexing sessions, with automatic recovery on next run
- **Git worktree support**: Branch detection now works correctly in git worktrees by resolving `.git` file pointers to the actual git directory
- **Index metadata contract**: Stores embedding provider, model, and dimensions in the database; blocks searches against incompatible indexes with clear error messages and `force=true` rebuild instructions
- **Google `gemini-embedding-001` model**: Support for Google's latest embedding model with Matryoshka truncation (3072D → 1536D) and task-specific embeddings (`CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY` / `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`)
- **Google batch embedding**: Batch requests up to 20 texts per API call via `batchEmbedContents` endpoint
- **Compatibility warnings**: Provider mismatch (same model + dimensions) now logs a warning instead of forcing a rebuild
- **Windows support**: Native binaries now build on Windows MSVC across all 5 platform targets (macOS x86/ARM, Linux x86/ARM, Windows x86)

### Changed
- **Embedding API split**: `embed()` replaced by `embedQuery()` and `embedDocument()` to support task-specific embeddings (Google)
- **Type-safe embedding models**: `EMBEDDING_MODELS` constant as single source of truth; `EmbeddingProvider`, `EmbeddingModelName`, and related types derived at compile time
- **Google default model**: Updated from deprecated `text-embedding-004` to `text-embedding-005`
- **Tool formatting**: Extracted all formatting functions from `src/tools/index.ts` to `src/tools/utils.ts`
- **Exhaustive provider check**: `createEmbeddingProvider` uses `never` exhaustive check instead of default branch
- **ESM compatibility**: Build config adds `createRequire` shim for ESM entry points

### Fixed
- **SQLite bind parameter limit**: `get_missing_embeddings` and `get_embeddings_batch` now batch `IN (...)` queries to stay under `SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER` (999) — fixes crash on large codebases (thanks @zb1749)
- **Google embedding API endpoints**: Corrected single and batch request URLs
- **Index compatibility on force rebuild**: `clearIndex()` now deletes stale index metadata so provider changes take effect
- **Search/findSimilar initialization**: Both now call `ensureInitialized()` before compatibility check
- **Windows MSVC build**: Disabled usearch `simsimd` feature on Windows — MSVC lacks `_mm512_reduce_add_ph` intrinsic. Pinned usearch to 2.23.0 to avoid 2.24.0 `MAP_FAILED` regression. Committed `Cargo.lock` for reproducible CI builds.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-01-19

### Added
- **`requireProjectMarker` config option**: Prevents plugin from hanging when opened in non-project directories like home. When `true` (default), requires a project marker (`.git`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.) to enable file watching and auto-indexing.

### Fixed
- Plugin no longer hangs when OpenCode is opened in home directory or other large non-project directories

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-18

### Added
- **`find_similar` tool**: Find code similar to a given snippet for duplicate detection, pattern discovery, and refactoring prep. Paste code and find semantically similar implementations elsewhere in the codebase.
- **`codebase_peek` tool**: Token-efficient semantic search returning metadata only (file, line, name, type) without code content. Saves ~90% tokens compared to `codebase_search` for discovery workflows.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-01-18

### Fixed
- Rust code formatting (cargo fmt)
- CI publish workflow: use Node 24 + npm OIDC trusted publishing (no token required)

## [0.3.1] - 2025-01-18

### Added
- **Query embedding cache**: LRU cache (100 entries, 5min TTL) avoids redundant API calls for repeated searches
- **Query similarity matching**: Reuses cached embeddings for similar queries (Jaccard similarity ≥0.85)
- **Batch metadata lookup**: `VectorStore.getMetadata()` and `getMetadataBatch()` for efficient chunk retrieval
- **Parse timing metrics**: Tracks `parseMs` for tree-sitter parsing duration
- **Query cache stats**: Separate tracking for exact hits, similar hits, and misses

### Changed
- BM25 keyword search now uses `getMetadataBatch()` - O(n) instead of O(total) for result metadata lookup

### Fixed
- Remove console output from Logger (was leaking to stdout)
- Record embedding API metrics for search queries (previously only tracked during indexing)
- Record embedding API metrics during batch retries

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-16

### Added

### Changed
- Migrated from JSON file storage to SQLite database
- Improved rate limit handling for GitHub Models API (15 req/min)

## [0.1.11] - 2025-01-07
