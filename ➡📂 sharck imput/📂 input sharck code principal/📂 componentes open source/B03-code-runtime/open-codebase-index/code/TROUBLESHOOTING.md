# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and solutions for open-codebase-index.

## 🚑 Quick Triage (fastest path)

If you're unsure where to start, run this sequence first:

1. `/status` (check whether index exists and provider/model look right)
2. `index_health_check` (clean stale/orphaned index data)
3. `/index force` (full rebuild when status/health still looks wrong)

Then jump to the relevant section below for provider, build, performance, or branch-specific issues.

## MCP Operations Stall or Report Transport Errors

Start a fresh MCP client session and call `index_status`. Its MCP structured content includes `mcpDiagnostics`:

- `active` means the owning process is still present and the operation is reporting activity within the configured window.
- `suspected_stall` means no phase or heartbeat has been observed within `mcp.stallTimeoutMs`. It does not prove that the process exited.
- `latestInterruptedOperation` appears only after ordered shutdown or after a later local process confirms that the recorded PID is absent.

The default inactivity window is five minutes. For diagnosis, lower it no further than `1000` milliseconds:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "stallTimeoutMs": 1000
  }
}
```

MCP errors include a stable code, phase, duration, retryability flag, and next action. Use `INDEX_BUSY` and `INDEX_UNAVAILABLE` guidance before rebuilding. For `PROVIDER_ERROR`, retry only when the response marks it retryable. `INTERNAL_ERROR` requires server log inspection.

This server can cancel exclusively owned cooperative work, release its index lease, roll back an active SQLite transaction, and preserve a process diagnostic after a forced exit. When indexing is shared, cancelling one caller detaches only that caller while the remaining consumers keep the underlying work alive. The server cannot reconnect a client that continues using a closed transport or replay the lost request. Codex may therefore require a new session even after the server is healthy. General client reconnection remains outside this repository and is tracked in [openai/codex#35486](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/35486) and [openai/codex#16899](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/16899). [openai/codex#34957](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/34957) is a partial client-side fix, not general transport reconnection.

## OpenCode Hangs in Home Directory

**Symptoms:**
- OpenCode becomes unresponsive when opened in home directory (`~`)
- New session starts but nothing happens when typing
- High CPU or memory usage

**Cause:** The plugin's file watcher attempts to watch the entire home directory, which contains hundreds of thousands of files.

**Solutions:**

### Default Behavior (v0.4.1+)
The plugin now requires a project marker (`.git`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.) by default. If no marker is found, file watching and auto-indexing are disabled. You'll see this warning:
```
[codebase-index] Skipping file watching and auto-indexing: no project marker found
```

### If You Need to Index a Non-Project Directory
Set `requireProjectMarker` to `false` in your config:
```json
{
  "indexing": {
    "requireProjectMarker": false
  }
}
```

**Warning:** Only do this for specific directories you intend to index. Never disable this for your home directory.

### Recognized Project Markers
The plugin looks for any of these files/directories:
- `.git`
- `package.json`
- `Cargo.toml`
- `go.mod`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `setup.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `Gemfile`
- `composer.json`
- `pom.xml`
- `build.gradle`
- `CMakeLists.txt`
- `Makefile`

Runtime state directories such as `.opencode` and `.codebase-index` are intentionally not project markers because the host or plugin can create them in otherwise empty directories.

## No Embedding Provider Available

**Error message:**
```
No embedding provider available. Configure OpenAI, Google, Ollama, or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
```

**Cause:** The plugin cannot find any configured embedding provider credentials.

**Solutions:**

### Option 1: Use OpenAI
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Or set in your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`).

### Option 2: Use Google (Gemini)
```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
```

### Option 3: Use Ollama (local, free)
```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
# Then pull the embedding model:
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

```json
// .opencode/codebase-index.json
{
  "embeddingProvider": "ollama"
}
```

### Verify Provider Detection
Run `/status` in OpenCode to see which provider is detected.

Auto-detect tries providers in this order:
1. Ollama
2. OpenAI
3. Google

---

## Rate Limiting Errors

**Error messages:**
```
429 Too Many Requests
Rate limit exceeded
Too many requests
```

**Cause:** The embedding provider is rejecting requests due to rate limits.

**Solutions:**

### For OpenAI and Google
These providers can enforce quota limits. The plugin automatically:
- Uses provider defaults for concurrency and request timing
- Retries with exponential backoff on transient rate-limit errors

**If still hitting limits:**
1. Wait 1-2 minutes and retry
2. Switch to a different provider for large codebases:
   ```json
   { "embeddingProvider": "ollama" }
   ```

### For OpenAI
1. Check your OpenAI account tier (free tier has lower limits)
2. Consider switching to a paid tier
3. For OpenAI-heavy workloads, switch to Ollama for initial indexing, then switch back

### For Google
1. Check your quota at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Verify your API credentials can access Gemini embeddings.

If you see provider/model errors, verify that your configured Google credentials have access to the Gemini embeddings API.

### For Large Codebases (1k+ files)
Use Ollama locally to avoid external rate limits:
```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```
```json
{ "embeddingProvider": "ollama" }
```

## Index Corruption / Stale Results

**Symptoms:**
- Search returns deleted files
- Results don't match current code
- "Chunk not found" errors

**Solutions:**

### Run Health Check
```
/status
```
Then ask the agent to run `index_health_check` to remove orphaned entries.

### Force Re-index
Ask the agent:
> "Force reindex the codebase"

Or run `/index force`.

Only use force reindex for a full rebuild. If `/status` reports failed embedding batches, fix the provider/auth issue first and rerun `/index` normally.

### Persisted Runtime Cache Warnings

Git project indexes keep branch-specific runtime state in `file-hashes.<branch-hash>.json` and `failed-batches.<branch-hash>.json`. Non-Git project indexes and global indexes use the corresponding unnamespaced filenames.

If debug logs report that one of these files is corrupted or unreadable, the indexer safely resets that branch's in-memory hash cache or skips its persisted retry batches for the run. If the warning recurs, remove the exact affected file reported in the warning and rebuild with `/index force`.

### Reset Everything
Delete the index directory for your host only after confirming you no longer need the existing index:

```bash
# OpenCode project index
rm -rf .opencode/index/

# Codex, Pi, or Jcode project index
rm -rf .codebase-index/index/

# Claude project index
rm -rf .claude/index/
```

The next indexing request will rebuild from scratch. Prefer `index_health_check` and a normal incremental index before deleting the entire index.

## Embedding Provider Changed

**Error message:**
```
Index incompatible: <reason>. Run index with force=true to rebuild.
```

**Cause:** The index was built with a different embedding provider or model than what's currently configured. Embeddings from different providers have different dimensions and are not compatible.

**Common scenarios:**
- Switched from one embedding provider to another
- Changed Ollama embedding model
- Updated to a new version of the embedding model

**Solutions:**

### Force Re-index
Ask the agent:
> "Force reindex the codebase"

Or run `/index` with the force option. This will:
1. Delete all existing embeddings
2. Re-index all files with the new provider

### Why This Happens
Different embedding providers produce vectors with different dimensions:

| Provider | Model | Dimensions |
|----------|-------|------------|
| OpenAI | text-embedding-3-small | 1536 |
| Google | text-embedding-004 | 768 |
| Ollama | nomic-embed-text | 768 |

Mixing embeddings from different providers would produce garbage search results, so the plugin refuses to search until you rebuild the index.

### Check Current Index Metadata
Run `/status` to see what provider/model the index was built with.

## Native Module Build Failures

**Error messages:**
```
Error loading native module
NAPI_RS error
dyld: Library not loaded
```

**Cause:** The pre-built native binary for your platform is missing or incompatible.

**Solutions:**

### Check Supported Platforms
Pre-built binaries are available for:
- macOS x64 (Intel)
- macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- Linux x64 (glibc)
- Linux arm64 (glibc)
- Windows x64

### Rebuild from Source
Requires Rust toolchain:
```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Rebuild native module
cd native
cargo build --release
npx napi build --release --platform
```

### Linux Musl Issues
If on Alpine Linux or musl-based systems, you need to build from source:
```bash
# Install musl target
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Build
cd native
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

## Slow Indexing Performance

**Symptoms:**
- Initial indexing takes very long
- Progress seems stuck

**Causes and Solutions:**

### 1. Large Codebase with Cloud Provider
Cloud providers have network latency and rate limits.

**Solution:** Use Ollama locally:
```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```
```json
{ "embeddingProvider": "ollama" }
```

### 2. Many Large Files
Files over 1MB are skipped by default, but many medium-sized files can still be slow.

**Solution:** Increase chunk limits or enable semantic-only mode:
```json
{
  "indexing": {
    "semanticOnly": true,
    "maxChunksPerFile": 50
  }
}
```

### 3. Provider Rate Limits
Provider-specific settings vary by quota and account tier. See the earlier rate-limiting guidance for provider-specific behavior.

**Solution:** For initial indexing, use a faster provider, then switch back:
```json
{ "embeddingProvider": "openai" }
```

### Check Progress
Run `/status` to see current index stats and estimate remaining work with:
> "Estimate indexing cost"

---

## Search Returns No Results

**Symptoms:**
- Queries return empty results
- "No matches found" for queries that should match

**Solutions:**

### 1. Check Index Status
```
/status
```
Verify the index exists and has chunks.

### 2. Index Hasn't Run Yet
Run `/index` to index the codebase.

### 3. Query Too Vague or Too Specific
Semantic search works best with descriptive queries:

| Bad Query | Better Query |
|-----------|--------------|
| "auth" | "authentication middleware that validates JWT tokens" |
| "error" | "error handling for failed API calls" |
| "user" | "function that creates new user accounts" |

### 4. Similarity Threshold Too High
Lower the minimum score:
```json
{
  "search": {
    "minScore": 0.05
  }
}
```

### 5. Files Excluded
Check if your files are being excluded by `exclude` globs, `.gitignore`, or size limits:
> "Run `/index` in verbose mode"

This shows which files were skipped and why. `exclude` omits matching files from the index even when they also match `include`. After changing `exclude`, rerun `/index` (not force) so stale failed-batch retries for those paths are dropped. `.git/info/exclude` is not read.

---

## Branch-Related Issues

### Stale Results After Branch Switch

**Cause:** The branch catalog may not have updated.

**Solution:**
1. Check current branch detection:
   ```
   /status
   ```
2. Re-index to update the branch catalog:
   ```
   /index
   ```

### Wrong Branch Detected

**Cause:** Detached HEAD or unusual git state.

**Solution:** Check your git state:
```bash
git status
cat .git/HEAD
```

The plugin reads `.git/HEAD` directly. If you're in detached HEAD state, it uses the commit SHA as the "branch" name.

### Index Not Updating on Branch Switch

**Cause:** File watcher may not be running.

**Solution:** Enable file watching:
```json
{
  "indexing": {
    "watchFiles": true
  }
}
```

Or manually trigger re-index after switching branches:
```
/index
```
