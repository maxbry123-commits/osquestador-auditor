/**
 * {@link Seeker} over tree leaves, making keys/values accessible to user. Given a starting leaf
 * and key range this cursor traverses each leaf and its right siblings as long as visited keys are within
 * key range. Each visited key within the key range can be accessible using {@link #key()}.
 * The instances provided by {@link Seeker#key()} and {@link Seeker#value()} are mutable and overwritten with new values
 * for every call to {@link #next()} so user cannot keep references to key/value instances, expecting them
 * to keep their values intact.
 * <p>
 * Concurrent writes can happen in the visited nodes and tree structure may change. This implementation
 * guards for that by re-reading if change happens underneath, but will not provide a consistent view of
 * the data as it were when the seek starts.
 * <p>
 * Seek can be performed forwards or backwards, returning hits in ascending or descending order respectively
 * (as defined by {@link Layout#compare(Object, Object)}). Direction is decided on relation between
 * {@link #fromInclusive} and {@link #toExclusive}. Backwards seek is expected to be slower than forwards seek
 * because extra care needs to be taken to make sure no keys are skipped when keys are moved to the right in the tree.
 * See detailed documentation about difficult cases below.
 * <pre>
 * If fromInclusive <= toExclusive, then seek forwards, otherwise seek backwards
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: there are assumptions that keys are unique in the tree.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note on backwards seek</strong>
 * <p>
 * To allow for lock free concurrency control the GBPTree agree to only move keys between nodes in 'forward' direction,
 * from left to right. This means when we do normal forward seek we never risk having keys moved 'passed' us and
 * therefore we can always be sure that we never miss any keys when traversing the leaf nodes or end up in the middle
 * of the range when traversing down the internal nodes. This assumption, of course, does not hold when seeking
 * backwards.
 * There are two complicated cases where we risk missing keys.
 * Case 1 - Split in current node
 * Case 2 - Split in next node while seeker is moving to that node
 * <p>
 * <strong>Case 1 - Split in current node</strong>
 * <p>
 * <em>Forward seek</em>
 * <p>
 * Here, the seeker is seeking forward and has read K0, K1, K2 and is about to read K3.
 * Then K4 is suddenly inserted and a split happens.
 * Seeker will now wake up and find that he is now outside the range of (previously returned key, end of range).
 * But he knows that he can continue to read forward until he hits the previously returned key, which is K2 and
 * then continue to return the next key, K3.
 * <pre>
 *     Seeker->
 *        v
 * [K0 K1 K2 K3]
 *
 *     Seeker->
 *        v
 * [K0 K1 __ __]<->[K2 K3 K4 __]
 * </pre>
 * <em>Backward seek</em>
 * <p>
 * Here, the seeking is seeking backwards and has only read K3 and is about to read K2.
 * Again, K4 is inserted, causing the same split as above.
 * Seeker now wakes up and find that the next key he can return is K1. What he do not see is that K2 has been
 * moved to the previous sibling and so, because he can not find the previously returned key, K3, in the current
 * node and because the next to return, K1, is located to the far right in the current node he need to jump back to
 * the previous sibling to find where to start again.
 * <pre>
 *      <-Seeker
 *           v
 * [K0 K1 K2 K3]
 *
 *      <-Seeker (WRONG)
 *           v
 * [K0 K1 __ __]<->[K2 K3 K4 __]
 *
 *                <-Seeker (RIGHT)
 *                     v
 * [K0 K1 __ __]<->[K2 K3 K4 __]
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Case 2 - Split in next node while seeker is moving to that node</strong>
 * <p>
 * <em>Forward seek</em>
 * <p>
 * Seeker has read K0, K1 on node 1  and has just moved to right sibling, node 2.
 * Now, K6 is inserted and a split  happens in node 2, right sibling of node 1.
 * Seeker wakes up and continues to read on node 2. Everything is fine.
 * <pre>
 *                   Seeker->
 *                      v
 * 1:[K0 K1 __ __]<->2:[K2 K3 K4 K5]
 *
 *                   Seeker->
 *                      v
 * 1:[K0 K1 __ __]<->2:[K2 K3 __ __]<->3:[K4 K5 K6 __]
 * </pre>
 * <em>Backward seek</em>
 * <p>
 * Seeker has read K4, K5 and has just moved to left sibling, node 1.
 * Insert K6, split in node 2. Note that keys are move to node 3, passed our seeker.
 * Seeker wakes up and see K1 as next key but misses K3 and K2.
 * <pre>
 *       <--Seeker
 *             v
 * 1:[K0 K1 K2 K3]<->2:[K4 K5 __ __]
 *
 *        <-Seeker
 *             v
 * 1:[K0 K1 __ __]<->3:[K2 K3 K4 __]<->2:[K5 K6 __ __]
 * </pre>
 * To guard for this, seeker 'scout' next sibling before moving there and read first key that he expect to see, K3
 * in this case. By using a linked cursor to 'scout' we create a consistent read over the node gap. If there is
 * suddenly another key when he goes there he knows that he could have missed some keys and he needs to go back until
 * he find the place where he left off, K4.
