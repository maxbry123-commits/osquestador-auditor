/**
 * A simple cache that keeps the last {@value #DEFAULT_METADATA_CACHE_SIZE} added transaction metadata records.
 * <p>
 * It behaves like a cache with Least recent added eviction policy.
 * <p>
 * Notes about the concurrency:
 * One of the design goal of this cache is low memory footprint, therefore it uses simple collections
 * guarded by a read-write lock. Concurrent collections like ConcurrentHashMap could have been used for improved
 * concurrency, but they would take more memory. The concurrent use of this cache should not be anywhere near
 * a simple read-write lock vs. concurrent collections making any performance difference.
