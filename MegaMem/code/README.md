# MegaMem — Obsidian × Knowledge Graph × MCP

> **Temporal memory for AI assistants, powered by your Private vault**

MegaMem is an Obsidian plugin that syncs your notes into a **temporal knowledge graph** (powered by [Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti)) and exposes it to AI assistants through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Claude, and any other MCP-compatible client, can read, search, and write to your vault — and remember things across conversations.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 Temporal Knowledge Graph

Sync your Obsidian notes to a graph database. Entities become nodes, relationships are extracted by AI, and every fact is timestamped so the graph evolves as your knowledge does — without losing history.

### 🔍 Auto Schema Discovery

The plugin scans your vault's frontmatter and automatically infers entity types, property types, and relationships. No manual schema definition required. Write your notes, the schema emerges.

### 🌐 Multi-Database & Multi-Vault _(new in v1.5.0)_

Configure multiple named graph databases simultaneously — each with its own connection, type (Neo4j/FalkorDB), and embedding model. A **masterVault** runs the MCP server and manages all databases across all registered vaults. Tell Claude which database to query, or let it discover available databases with `list_databases`.

### 🤖 23 MCP Tools for AI Assistants

A full MCP server (12 graph tools + 11 vault file tools) gives Claude — or any MCP client — direct, structured access to your knowledge. Search memories, add episodes, read and write notes, explore folders, all from your AI conversation.

### 🏗️ Custom Ontology Manager

Define your own entity types, edge types, and property descriptions. Generate Pydantic models with one click. The AI understands your custom data structures during extraction.

### ⚡ Obsidian CLI Integration

All 10 file operation tools run through the native **Obsidian CLI** (v1.12+) — stateless subprocess calls with no persistent WebSocket, no connection race conditions, no heartbeat. Multi-vault support via a single `vault_id` parameter. Non-markdown files (`.pdf`, `.png`, `.csv`, `.base`, etc.) are now fully supported across all file tools.

### 🌐 Streamable HTTP MCP Transport _(new in v1.4.0)_

Connect **Roo Code, Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, NemoClaw, and any HTTP-capable MCP client** directly to MegaMem — no Claude Desktop required. Enable the opt-in Streamable HTTP server (MCP spec 2025-03-26) in Plugin Settings → Servers. Token Profiles let you create scoped bearer tokens per client, each with a one-click Copy Config for all 6 supported clients. Remote access via Tailscale is supported via a per-profile Endpoint URL field.

### 🔄 Intelligent Sync

Auto-sync on interval, sync on demand, or trigger from MCP. Filter by folder inclusion/exclusion. Choose "new only" or "new + updated". Sync state is tracked in a local **SQLite database** (`sync.db`) — per-note, per-database, with content hashing to skip unchanged notes and full analytics logging (token counts, entity counts, sync duration).

### 📊 Sync Analytics Dashboard _(new in v1.5.5)_

The unified **MegaMem panel** (brain icon, copper accent) combines Ontology, Sync, and Analytics in a single tabbed sidebar. The **Analytics tab** provides a comprehensive dashboard: animated summary cards (Synced Notes, Entities Extracted, Edges Created, LLM Cost + Embed sub-label), a **Sync Timeline** with Entities / Edges / LLM Cost right-axis toggle, **Token Usage by Model** (Big / Small / Both views), a sortable **Model Performance table** (Provider, Embed Cost, Total Cost), and a **Synced Notes accordion** with per-session detail including Embed Model and Embed Cost.

### ✦ MegaMem Pro _(new)_

A dedicated **Pro tab** in plugin settings for licensed Stewards. Validate your API key, check and install content packages (vault templates, ontology packs), and access upcoming hosted services — all in-plugin. Free plan users keep all MCP tools; Pro is content delivery and future hosted features.

## 📋 How It Works

### 1. Schema Discovery

The plugin scans your vault frontmatter and infers entity types and properties:

```yaml
---
type: Person
name: "Jane Smith"
role: "Researcher"
organization: "TechCorp"
tags: ["AI", "Knowledge Graphs"]
---
```

### 2. Pydantic Model Generation

Your frontmatter patterns become typed Graphiti extraction models:

```python
class Person(BaseNode):
    name: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Person's full name")
    role: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Current role or title")
    organization: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Current employer")
```

### 3. Temporal Graph Sync

Notes are processed through Graphiti's extraction pipeline:

- Entities become graph nodes with versioned properties
- Relationships are extracted from note content via LLM
- Sync state tracked in SQLite (`sync.db`) per-note/per-DB with content hashing — unchanged notes are skipped automatically
- AI assistants query this structured graph via MCP

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Component | Minimum                 | Notes                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Obsidian  | **1.12.4+ (installer)** | Must run the full installer — in-app updates don't enable CLI |
| Python    | 3.11+                   | Managed automatically via UV                                  |
| Database  | Neo4j 5+ or FalkorDB 1+ | Neo4j Desktop is easiest for local use                        |

> ⚠️ **Obsidian installer required**: Download and run the full installer from [obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download). In-app auto-update does **not** update the CLI binary. Then go to `Settings → General → Command line interface → Register`.

### Install via BRAT _(recommended)_

1. Install [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) from Community Plugins
2. BRAT → **Add Beta Plugin** → paste `C-Bjorn/megamem-mcp`
3. A dialog appears after ~3 seconds: click **"Install / Update Components"**
   - Downloads and installs `graphiti_bridge` + `mcp-server` automatically
4. Plugin is ready

### 7-Step Setup

**Step 0 — Register Obsidian CLI** _(required for file tools)_
Run the Obsidian 1.12.4+ installer → `Settings → General → CLI → Register` → restart terminal → verify with `obsidian version`

**Step 1 — Set up a graph database**
[Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/) (recommended) or FalkorDB via Docker. See [Database Setup Guide](https://c-bjorn.github.io/MegaMem/#/guides/database-setup).

**Step 2 — Install Python dependencies**
Plugin Settings → Python Environment → **"Install Dependencies"** (uses UV by default — works on macOS/Windows/Linux).

**Step 3 — Configure LLM provider**
Plugin Settings → API Keys → enter your key. Click **"Load Defaults"** to populate recommended models.

**Step 4 — Connect the database**
Plugin Settings → Database Configuration → enter your connection details → **"Test Connection"** → **"Initialize Schema"**.

**Step 5 — Connect your MCP client**
- **Claude Desktop (stdio):** Plugin Settings → Servers → **STDIO MCP Server** → **"Generate Config"** → paste into `claude_desktop_config.json` → restart Claude Desktop.
- **HTTP clients (Roo Code, Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, NemoClaw):** Plugin Settings → Servers → **Streamable HTTP Access** → enable toggle → expand the **Admin token profile** → click the **Copy Config** button for your client. No Claude Desktop needed.

**Step 6 — (Optional) Configure sync**
Advanced sync settings (auto-sync toggle, sync interval, included folders) are in Plugin Settings → **Advanced Settings** tab → **Auto-Sync**. Excluded folders and per-note extraction settings are in General → Sync Configuration.

**Step 7 — Start syncing**
Three ways to sync:

- **Single note:** click the **sync icon** (top-right of any note window) to sync the current note
- **Bulk sync / Analytics:** click the **🧠 brain icon** in the ribbon to open the unified **MegaMem panel** → switch to the **Sync** tab for bulk operations
- **Command palette:** `MegaMem: Open Sync` / `MegaMem: Open Analytics` / `MegaMem: Open Ontology`

> ⚠️ **Notes must have a `type` property in their frontmatter to use bulk Sync (when Custom Ontology is enabled).**

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Personal Knowledge Management

Build a graph of the people, projects, ideas, and relationships in your life. Ask Claude "what do I know about X?" and get answers drawn from your actual notes, with full temporal context. It works as a personal CRM, project tracker, and second brain — all from your existing vault without restructuring anything.

### AI-Assisted Note-Taking

With 9 native Obsidian file tools, Claude can create, search, and update notes directly in your vault mid-conversation. Draft a meeting note, file it in the right folder, sync it to the graph — all in one step, without leaving the chat.

_Also great for:_ research & academia (literature graphs, citation tracking), business intelligence (competitor research, knowledge bases), creative projects (world-building, character arcs), and multi-team knowledge management with namespaced vaults.

## 🔮 Roadmap

### Shipped ✅

- **Native Template Engine** — `create_note_with_template` resolves templates from an ordered list of configured source vaults/folders (personal + company precedence) and renders the honest `<% %>` subset natively — no Templater dependency required in the target vault; works headless for agent/client vaults. Registry-aware candidate matching returns a ranked, enriched `candidates` list (with `whenToUse`/`category`) when no confident match exists, discovered via filter-introspection against `.base` files rather than a fixed folder-adjacency convention. Templater interop guard auto-manages the "ignore folders on creation" list to prevent template-syntax corruption. CLI transport only; WebSocket path unaffected _(v1.7.5)_
- **OpenRouter Embedding Models** — Model Library → Embedding Models now fetches live catalog from `/api/v1/embeddings/models` (25 embedded seeds available without API key); Multimodal/Free/ZDR filter bar; Python bridge supports `embedder_provider: openrouter` _(v1.6.9)_
- **Template Scaffold Return** — `create_note_with_template` returns `content` + `instructions` in response; 2-call workflow (create → update, no read needed) _(v1.6.9)_
- **Analytics: Embed Cost + Timeline Toggles** — Embed cost tracked per sync (content_length/4 × embedder pricing); Embed Cost column + Embed Model in Synced Notes detail; Sync Timeline right-axis toggle: Entities | Edges | LLM Cost _(v1.6.9)_
- **Unified MegaMem Panel & Sync Analytics Dashboard** — brain icon ribbon, tabbed panel (Ontology | Sync | Analytics), animated summary cards, Timeline chart, Token Usage by Model (Big/Small/Both), sortable Model Performance table with Provider column, Synced Notes accordion, Sync Health indicators, bundled model pricing _(v1.5.5)_
- **SQLite Sync Registry** — `sync.db` replaces `sync.json`; per-note/per-DB content hashing (skip unchanged), full analytics logging (token counts, entity/edge counts, duration, model used), episode UUID chain via SQLite (no more `mm_uid` frontmatter writes) _(v1.5.5)_
- **Multi-database support** — multiple named Neo4j/FalkorDB targets, per-DB embedding config, sync dropdown per note _(v1.5)_
- **Multi-vault architecture** — masterVault control panel, childVault registration, MCP `database_id` routing, `list_databases` tool _(v1.5)_
- Temporal knowledge graph sync (Graphiti + Neo4j/FalkorDB)
- 22 MCP tools — 11 graph operations + 11 Obsidian file tools (including `manage_obsidian_base` for `.base` files)
- Obsidian CLI integration (stateless, multi-vault, no WebSocket)
- Auto schema discovery from vault frontmatter
- Custom ontology manager with Pydantic model generation
- Model Library — live model fetching from LLM providers; OpenRouter now supports embedding model fetch via `/api/v1/embeddings/models`; pricing synced to analytics DB for cost tracking
- Constrained ontology generation (edge type cap + deduplication)
- Ontology file separation (`ontology.json` split from `data.json`)
- Auto-update system — Python components auto-install and self-update
- MegaMem Pro tab — license validation + content package delivery

### In Progress / Near-term 🔄
