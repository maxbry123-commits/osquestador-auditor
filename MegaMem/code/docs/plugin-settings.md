### License Key

Enter your `mm_live_...` API key and click **Validate**. The key is stored in `data.json` and validated against `megamem.endogon.com`.

**States:**
- **Empty** — helper text with link to [endogon.com/stewards](https://endogon.com/stewards)
- **Validating** — input disabled, spinner
- **Valid** — green banner showing plan name, masked key, and expiry ("Active subscription" if on recurring plan) + **Remove Key** button
- **Invalid** — red error message, input stays editable

### Content Packages

Only visible when a valid key is present. Shows one card per entitled package from your plan.

**Each card displays:**
- Package name and description
- Installed version vs. available version
- Status badge: **Not installed** / **Update available (vX.Y.Z)** / **Up to date**
- **Install** or **Update** button (absent when up to date)

On install/update: the plugin fetches a signed download URL from the edge function, downloads the zip, and extracts it to your vault root. `MegaMemPro/Version.md` is the version sentinel.

### Premium Features

Placeholder for upcoming hosted services — currently shows the **Ask Bjørn** coming-soon card.

### Venice.ai API Key <i data-lucide="alert-triangle"></i>
- Description: API key for Venice.ai services
- Developer Note: Basic API connection implemented but not fully supported yet. Use with caution.

### OpenRouter API Key <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: API key for OpenRouter services
- Developer Note: Required for OpenRouter models and presets. Fully implemented and tested.

### Ollama - Fully Private Local Models <i data-lucide="alert-triangle"></i>
- Description: Run AI models locally on your machine without sending data to external services
- Developer Note: NOT fully working - pending development to support JSON schema for custom entities (works ok with generic entities). Complete local model management with installation, status checking, and model downloads.

#### Actions:
- **Install Ollama** <i data-lucide="download"></i>: Downloads and installs Ollama on your system
- **Refresh Status** <i data-lucide="refresh-cw"></i>: Checks Ollama installation status and available models

### Validate All API Keys <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
#### Actions:
- **Validate API Keys** <i data-lucide="shield-check"></i>: Validates all configured API keys without testing models

## Model Library <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>

Fetch and manage available models from your configured LLM providers. Appears between API Keys and LLM Configuration.

- **Purpose**: Discover models available from each provider's API, curate a personal short-list, and control which models appear in LLM Configuration dropdowns.
- **Developer Note**: Fetched model data is cached in `model-library-cache.json` (separate from `data.json` for performance). Cache TTL is 24 hours.

### Fetch All Models
#### Actions:
- **Fetch All Models** <i data-lucide="download"></i>: Queries all configured providers simultaneously for their current model catalog
- **Clear Cache** <i data-lucide="trash"></i>: Clears the model library cache — next fetch will pull fresh data

### LLM Models / Embedding Models

For each section, select a provider and click **Fetch** to load its model list.

**Capability Filters (OpenRouter only):**

| Filter | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🟢 Graphiti Compatible | Model supports both `structured_outputs` AND `temperature` — works reliably with Graphiti's knowledge extraction pipeline |
| Structured Outputs | Supports `json_schema` response format |
| Tool Use | Supports function calling |
| Vision | Accepts image inputs |
| ZDR | Zero Data Retention — provider does not use your data for training |

> **Important for OpenRouter users**: Always filter by **🟢 Graphiti Compatible** when selecting models for sync. GPT-5/o1/o3 models support structured outputs but reject the `temperature` parameter, causing 404 routing errors with Graphiti's extraction pipeline.

**Model Row Controls:**
- **Checkbox**: Toggle model on/off in your short-list. Enabled models appear in LLM Configuration dropdowns.
- **★ badge**: Recommended by MegaMem (from built-in defaults)
- **Metadata badges**: Context window (e.g. `128K`), dimensions for embeddings, pricing (`$/1M` tokens)

> **Note**: When 11 or more models are in your short-list, the LLM Model selector switches from a dropdown to a searchable text input with keyboard autocomplete (↑↓ Enter Esc).

## LLM Configuration

Configure language model providers and specific models.

### LLM Defaults
#### Actions:
- **Load Defaults** <i data-lucide="download"></i>: Merge recommended defaults into your current settings without overwriting custom entries

## Database Configuration

Configure your graph database backend(s). As of **v1.5**, MegaMem supports multiple named databases simultaneously.

### Databases List <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>

The "Databases" accordion shows all configured database targets. Each entry collapses to a summary row and expands to a full edit form.

**Summary row shows:** label, type badge (Neo4j / FalkorDB), embedding model, enabled state.

**Expanded edit form fields:**
- **Label**: Human-readable name (e.g., "Personal Neo4j", "Company Graph")
- **Type**: Neo4j or FalkorDB
- **URI / Host / Port**: Connection coordinates
- **Username / Password / Database Name**: Authentication
- **Embedding Provider**: Per-database embedding provider (OpenAI, Google, Voyage, Ollama)
- **Embedding Model**: Per-database embedding model
- **Embedding Dimensions** *(Ollama only)*: Required when using Ollama embeddings

**Actions per entry:**
- **Test Connection**: Verifies connection to this specific database
- **Remove**: Deletes this database configuration

**Add Database:** Opens an inline form to add a new database entry. Fill connection details and embedding config, then save.

> **Note:** Existing single-database configs are auto-migrated to `databases[0]` on first load after upgrading to v1.5. No manual action required.

> **Note:** The Multi-Vault Mode accordion has moved to the **Advanced Settings** tab.

### Sync Identity (Per-Database Icons)

Each named database can have a configurable **Lucide icon** and **icon color** shown in the note ribbon and file explorer:
- **Icon**: Lucide icon name (quick-pick buttons for common choices: brain, database, cloud, server, archive, etc.). Default: `brain`.
- **Icon Color**: Hex color for the icon. Default: `#fea120`.
- **Write Sync Breadcrumb**: When enabled, writes an `mm_sync: {db_label: ISO-timestamp}` entry to note frontmatter after sync — useful for shared Relay folders so partners can see what's been synced.

These settings are available both when **editing an existing database** and when **adding a new database**.

> **Sync State**: As of v1.6, sync state is stored in `sync.db` (SQLite) — a local database inside the plugin directory. This replaces the old `sync.json` file. Migration from sync.json happens automatically on first load.

### Multi-Vault Mode <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>

> **Located in:** Advanced Settings tab → Multi-Vault Mode accordion.

A dedicated **"Multi-Vault Mode"** accordion controls master/child vault relationships.

**Master Vault toggle:** When enabled, this vault runs the MCP server and shows a "Registered Child Vaults" panel.

**Registered Child Vaults** *(masterVault only)*: Lists vaults registered as children. Each entry shows vault path, linked database, and a Remove button.

**Register Child Vault:** Opens a form to register another Obsidian vault. Vaults are auto-discovered from the OS Obsidian registry (`obsidian.json`) and shown in a dropdown. On registration, the child vault's DB config is read and added to the master's `databases[]` array with `category: 'child-vault'`.

> **Child vault behaviour:** When a vault is registered as a child, its MCP settings show an info notice: "MCP Server is managed by masterVault." MCP is disabled in child mode.

### Database Testing and Setup
#### Actions:
- **Test Connection** <i data-lucide="database"></i>: Verify connection for the selected database configuration
- **Initialize Schema** <i data-lucide="table"></i>: Set up the required Graphiti schema in your database (run after successful connection test)

## Python Environment

**IMPORTANT**: This section appears first in the plugin settings. Python dependencies must be installed before anything will work properly.

### Python Path (Optional) <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Specify custom Python executable path (leave empty for auto-detection)
- Developer Note: Allows custom Python interpreter specification.

### Python Dependency Management
**Installation Methods:**
- **UV Package Manager (Recommended)**: Default installation method with better cross-platform compatibility for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Handles platform-specific archive formats automatically.
- **System Python**: For advanced users who prefer to use their own Python installation.

#### Actions:
- **Check Dependencies** <i data-lucide="search"></i>: Check if Graphiti Python dependencies are installed
- **Install Dependencies** <i data-lucide="package-plus"></i>: Install Graphiti and required Python packages. The default UV method downloads the uv package manager and uses it to create an isolated Python environment with all required dependencies.

### Python Environment Location <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: The Python virtual environment is **vault-specific** — each Obsidian vault gets its own isolated environment to prevent conflicts between vaults.
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MegaMem\python\{vault-name}\venv`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/MegaMem/python/{vault-name}/venv`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/MegaMem/python/{vault-name}/venv`
- Developer Note: On first upgrade from an older version, the shared venv is automatically copied to the vault-specific location. No manual action required.

## Sync Configuration

Configure per-note sync behavior, extraction settings, and folder exclusions.

> **Auto-sync settings** (schedule, interval, included folders) have moved to **Advanced Settings → Auto-Sync**.

Settings in this accordion (in order):

### Episode Contributor <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Your name or ID — injected as `mm_contributor` on every synced episode. Useful in shared team databases. Leave blank to omit.

### Global Extraction Instructions <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Free-text instructions injected into Graphiti's extraction prompts for all notes. Guides the LLM on what to extract, what to ignore, or how to interpret your vault's content. Can be overridden per namespace in Custom Folder Mappings.

### Wikilink Extraction Hints <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: When enabled, `[[wikilinks]]` found in the note body are injected as entity hints in the LLM extraction instructions. Default: on.

### Property Inclusion Mode <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Controls which frontmatter properties are included in the episode body.
  - **Permissive (default)**: All frontmatter fields except Globally Ignored Fields
  - **Strict**: Only properties enabled in ontology.json for the note's entity type (requires Custom Ontologies)

### Excluded Folders <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Folders to exclude from sync (e.g., .obsidian, .trash).
- Developer Note: Dynamic folder exclusion management.

#### Actions:
- **Add Folder** <i data-lucide="folder-plus"></i>: Add a new folder to exclude from sync
- **Delete** <i data-lucide="x"></i>: Remove folder from exclusion list (per folder)

### Globally Ignored Fields <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: YAML frontmatter fields to exclude from the episode body sent to Graphiti. Default: `cssclass`, `mm_uid`, `mm_sync`. These fields are now actually stripped from the episode body (was silently broken in earlier versions).
- Developer Note: Filters happen in `sync.py` Stage 3 before YAML serialization.

#### Actions:
- **Add Field** <i data-lucide="plus"></i>: Add a new field to ignore globally
- **Delete** <i data-lucide="x"></i>: Remove field from ignore list (per field)

### Property Inclusion Mode <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Controls which frontmatter properties are included in the episode body sent to Graphiti.
  - **Permissive (default)**: All frontmatter fields except `Globally Ignored Fields`
  - **Strict**: Only properties that are enabled/checked in ontology.json for the note's entity type. Falls back to Permissive if the note's type has no ontology entry. Requires Custom Ontologies to be enabled.

### Wikilink Extraction Hints <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: When enabled, `[[wikilinks]]` found in the note body are injected as entity hints in the LLM extraction instructions. Obsidian wikilinks are the strongest entity signal available — this toggle ensures the LLM treats them as confirmed knowledge graph references. Default: on.

### Episode Contributor <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Your name or ID — injected as `mm_contributor` in every episode created by this vault. Useful in shared team databases to track who contributed each piece of knowledge. Applied to Obsidian note syncs, `add_memory`, and `add_conversation_memory`. Leave blank to omit the field.

### Recent Episodes for Context <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i> *(v1.7.0)*
- Setting key: `previousEpisodesLimit`
- Description: Number of recent episodes passed to Graphiti's extraction pipeline as prior context (default: **2**). Graphiti's default is 10 — each episode is a full note body (~5–10K chars) JSON-encoded into every fan-out LLM call (extract_nodes, dedupe_nodes, extract_attributes, etc.). Capping at 2 reduces input tokens by ~80% on that window, yielding ~40–50% total sync cost reduction on large notes.
- Range: 0–10 (slider). 0 = no prior context. Raising to 5–10 improves cross-episode entity dedup at higher token cost.
- Developer Note: Serialized as `previous_episodes_limit` in `BridgeConfig` → `sync.py`. Applies at both the generic text path and the custom entity path.

### Source Description Key <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i> *(v1.7.0)*
- Setting key: `sourceDescriptionKey`
- Description: Optional frontmatter key whose value overrides the `source_description` stored with each episode in Graphiti. When set (e.g. to `"mm_source"`), the note's `mm_source` frontmatter value wins over `frontmatter.type` and the default config fallback. Enables multi-writer Graphiti federation scenarios (Issue #11). Leave empty to keep existing behavior unchanged.
- Developer Note: Serialized as `source_description_key` in `BridgeConfig` → `sync.py`. Applied at both sync paths before episode dispatch.

## Knowledge Namespacing

Configure how knowledge is organized in the graph database.

### Use Custom Ontology <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Enable custom entity types with pre-existing Pydantic models. When disabled, uses generic text episodes.
- Developer Note: Controls entity type customization level.

### Namespace Strategy <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Primary strategy for organizing knowledge in the graph
- Options: Vault Name, Folder Path, Property Value, Custom Value
- Developer Note: Intelligent preset controller for namespace organization.

### Default Namespace <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Default namespace when strategy is "custom" or when other strategies fail
- Developer Note: Fallback namespace configuration.

### Global Extraction Instructions <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Free-text instructions injected into Graphiti's extraction prompts for all notes. Use this to guide the LLM on what to extract, what to ignore, or how to interpret your vault's content.
- Developer Note: Applies globally to all synced notes. Can be overridden per namespace in Custom Folder Mappings.

### Enable Folder Namespacing <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Use top-level folder names as namespaces. Subfolders are not supported.
- Developer Note: Top-level folder-based namespace generation.

### Custom Folder Mappings <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Map specific folders to custom group_id namespaces. Leave empty to use automatic folder names. Each mapping row also supports per-namespace extraction instructions, saga grouping, and a saga property key.
- Developer Note: Advanced folder-to-namespace mapping with auto-population.

**Per-mapping options (available on each folder mapping row):**
- **Custom Extraction Instructions**: Override the global extraction instructions for this namespace only. When left empty, the vault-wide Global Extraction Instructions apply.
- **Saga Grouping**: How episodes from this namespace are grouped into sagas. Options: `By Note Type (default)`, `Single Saga for namespace`, `No saga grouping`, `Custom frontmatter property`.
- **Saga Property Key**: *(Visible when Saga Grouping = "Custom frontmatter property")* The frontmatter key whose value is used as the saga name.

#### Actions:
- **Add Folder Mapping** <i data-lucide="folder-plus"></i>: Add a new folder-to-namespace mapping
- **Delete** <i data-lucide="x"></i>: Remove folder mapping (per mapping)

### Enable Property Namespacing <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>
- Description: Use `mm_group_id` frontmatter property as namespace when available. (`g_group_id` is deprecated — still supported with a warning log, but rename to `mm_group_id`.)
- Developer Note: Property-based namespace detection.

### Namespace Discovery
#### Actions:
- **Generate** <i data-lucide="refresh-cw"></i>: Scan the vault and generate the list of available namespaces based on the settings above

### Enable Multi-Vault Mode <i data-lucide="wrench"></i>
- Description: Enable advanced features for managing multiple Obsidian vaults
- Developer Note: Multi-vault features planned for future release.

### Current Vault Priority <i data-lucide="wrench"></i>
- Description: Priority level for this vault in multi-vault scenarios (higher numbers = higher priority)

- **Bearer Token** — Auto-generated. Copy or Regenerate. Regenerating live-updates all Copy Config buttons.
- **Copy Config buttons** — One button per supported client (Roo Code, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, NemoClaw). Each copies the correctly formatted config for that client.
- **Access Restrictions** *(scoped profiles only)*:
  - **Allowed Tools** — Checkboxes per MCP tool.
  - **Allowed Group IDs** — Comma-separated namespace IDs. Empty = no restriction.
  - **Allowed Databases** — Checkboxes per configured database. Unchecked all = all allowed.
  - **Allowed Vaults** — Checkboxes per registered vault. Unchecked all = all allowed.

#### Copy Config Formats:

| Client | Format |
|--------|--------|
| **Roo Code** | `streamable-http` type JSON |
| **Claude Desktop** | `npx mcp-remote` command |
| **Claude Code** | `claude mcp add` CLI command |
| **Cursor** | `streamable-http` type JSON |
| **VS Code** | `servers` key, `http` type JSON |
| **NemoClaw** | `baseUrl` + `headers` JSON |

#### Actions:
- **+ Add Profile** — Create a new scoped token profile
- **Delete** *(per profile)* — Remove a profile
- **Regenerate** *(per profile)* — Rotate the token (invalidates the old one immediately)

### Current Instances _(below sub-accordions)_
