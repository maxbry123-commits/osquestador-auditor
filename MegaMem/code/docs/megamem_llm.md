# MegaMem

MegaMem is an advanced Obsidian plugin that bridges your personal knowledge vault with AI-powered graph databases, creating a seamless ecosystem for knowledge discovery, semantic search, and intelligent content management. With native Claude Desktop integration and support for multiple LLM providers, MegaMem transforms how you interact with your life.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Knowledge Extraction

- Intelligent entity recognition and relationship mapping
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter, Google, Groq, Azure, Venice)
- Custom ontology support for domain-specific knowledge modeling
- Content-hash pre-check skips syncs automatically when note content is unchanged

### Semantic Search

- Vector-based similarity search across your entire vault
- AI-enhanced query understanding
- Contextual result ranking and relevance scoring

### 🔗 OpenRouter Embedding Models _(v1.6.9)_

OpenRouter is now a full embedding provider. Model Library → Embedding Models → OpenRouter lets you fetch the live catalog from `/api/v1/embeddings/models` (requires API key) and toggle models on. Static seed list of all 25 known embedding models available without a key.

- **Dedicated API endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/embeddings/models` with Bearer auth
- **Embedding-specific filter bar**: 📷 Multimodal | 🆓 Free | ZDR
- **Python bridge**: `embedder_provider: 'openrouter'` routes through `OpenAIEmbedder(base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1")` — dimensions auto-detected
- **Per-DB embedding config**: OpenRouter available in Database Configuration → Embedding Provider dropdown
- **Embed cost tracking**: estimated from `content_length / 4 × embedder pricing` per sync

### ✅ Template Scaffold Return _(v1.6.9)_

`create_note_with_template` now returns `content` (full file scaffold) and `instructions` in the response. Note creation is a 2-call workflow: **create → update** (no read needed). LLMs that skip the intermediate read call will no longer produce malformed notes.

### 🪄 Templater Company Templates _(v1.6.5)_

`create_note_with_template` now discovers templates from both `templates_folder` (personal) and `company_templates_folder` (Templater fork) automatically. Company templates listed first; same-name templates deduped (company wins). Personal-only users unaffected.

### 🧠 Unified MegaMem Panel _(v1.5.5)_

A single copper-accented brain icon opens a tabbed side-panel with three sections:

- **Ontology tab** — custom entity/edge type management, Pydantic model generation
- **Sync tab** — Quick Sync (by note type), Advanced sync (granular selection), per-DB status
- **Analytics tab** — comprehensive sync analytics dashboard (see below)

### 📊 Sync Analytics Dashboard _(v1.5.5)_

Built on the local SQLite `sync.db`, the Analytics tab delivers full visibility into your sync operations:

- **Summary cards**: Synced Notes, Entities Extracted, Edges Created, LLM Cost (animated). LLM Cost shows an "Embed: $x" sub-label when embedding cost is tracked.
- **Sync Timeline**: Line/area chart — day or hour granularity. Right-axis toggle: **Entities | Edges | LLM Cost** (purple/green dashed overlays).
- **Token Usage by Model**: Stacked bar chart with Big Model / Small Model / Both toggle
- **Model Performance table**: Sortable by any column — includes Provider, Avg Duration, Avg In/Out Tokens, Avg Entities, Avg Edges, **Embed Cost**, Total Cost
- **Synced Notes accordion**: Expand each row for full detail: InTokens, OutTokens, TotalTokens, Duration, Small Model, **Embed Model**, **Embed Cost**, error message
- **Sync Health**: Recent failures with error messages, stale notes count, duration trend
- **Cost estimates**: LLM cost from `model_pricing` × token usage. Embed cost estimated from `content_length / 4` × embedder pricing (Option B). Exact embed tokens via API coming in a future patch (Option A).

### Multi-Database Support

- **Neo4j**: Industry-standard graph database for complex relationships
- **FalkorDB**: High-performance in-memory graph database for speed
- **Multiple simultaneous databases**: Configure named DB targets, each with its own connection, type, and embedding model. Sync individual notes to any database via a per-note dropdown.
- **Kuzu**: Coming soon
- **Amazon Neptune**: Coming soon

### Multi-Vault Architecture _(v1.5)_

- **masterVault**: One vault runs the MCP server and manages a unified database control panel for all vaults
- **childVault registration**: Register other Obsidian vaults via auto-discovery; their DB configs appear in the master's database list
- **MCP database routing**: All graph tools accept an optional `database_id` parameter to target a specific database
- **`list_databases` tool**: Let your AI assistant discover all configured database targets before running queries

### LLM Client Integration (ie. Claude Desktop)

- Native MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
- Direct access to vault content from LLM conversations
- Intelligent note creation and management through AI
- **MCP Resources** _(v1.6.5)_: `megamem://instructions` (usage guide loaded as system context), `megamem://instructions/reference` (full parameter reference on demand), `megamem://status` (live server health + log tail)

### Custom Ontologies

- Define domain-specific entity types and relationships
- Flexible schema management
- Advanced knowledge modeling capabilities

### Ollama - Fully Private Local Models <i data-lucide="alert-triangle"></i>

- Description: Run AI models locally on your machine without sending data to external services
- Developer Note: NOT fully working - pending development to support JSON schema for custom entities (works ok with generic entities). Complete local model management with installation, status checking, and model downloads.

#### Actions:

- **Install Ollama** <i data-lucide="download"></i>: Downloads and installs Ollama on your system
- **Refresh Status** <i data-lucide="refresh-cw"></i>: Checks Ollama installation status and available models

### Validate All API Keys <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>

#### Actions:

- **Validate API Keys** <i data-lucide="shield-check"></i>: Validates all configured API keys without testing models

## Model Library <i data-lucide="check-circle"></i>

Fetch and browse live model catalogs from your configured LLM providers. Curate a personal short-list — only short-listed models appear in LLM Configuration dropdowns.

### How it works

1. **Fetch All Models** — queries each configured provider's API simultaneously
2. **Browse** — scroll through models with metadata (context window, pricing, capabilities)
3. **Toggle** — check models on to add them to your short-list
4. Model cache is stored in `model-library-cache.json` (separate from main settings) and refreshed every 24 hours

### Capability Filters (OpenRouter)

When OpenRouter is selected, a capability filter bar appears above the model list:

| Filter                     | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 **Graphiti Compatible** | Supports `structured_outputs` **and** `temperature` — works with Graphiti's knowledge extraction pipeline. **Use this filter when selecting models for sync.** |
| Structured Outputs         | Supports `json_schema` format                                                                                                                                  |
| Tool Use                   | Supports function calling                                                                                                                                      |
| Vision                     | Accepts image inputs                                                                                                                                           |
| ZDR                        | Zero Data Retention                                                                                                                                            |

> **Why not just filter by Structured Outputs?** Some models (GPT-5, o1, o3 families) report `structured_outputs` support but reject the `temperature` parameter. Graphiti's pipeline always sends `temperature`, so these models will fail with a 404 routing error from OpenRouter. The **🟢 Graphiti Compatible** filter correctly excludes them.

### Recommended OpenRouter Models (tested with Graphiti)

| Model                                  | Notes                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openai/gpt-4.1`                       | ⭐ Recommended — best balance of capability and reliability |
| `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`                  | Best cost/performance ratio                                 |
| `openai/gpt-4o`                        | Legacy, still works                                         |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` | Works via OpenRouter                                        |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`          | Works via OpenRouter ✅                                     |
| `google/gemini-2.5-flash`              | Works via OpenRouter                                        |

> **Do NOT use** `openai/gpt-5`, `openai/gpt-5-mini`, `openai/o1`, `openai/o3` via OpenRouter — they reject the `temperature` parameter required by Graphiti (GitHub issue [#878](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti/issues/878)).

# MCP Commands Reference

This document lists all 22 available commands (tools) provided by the MegaMem MCP server: 11 MegaMem Graph Operations and 11 Obsidian File Operations (via CLI). Each command includes its description, parameters, and aliases, allowing for seamless interaction with the MegaMem knowledge graph and Obsidian vault.

> **Developer's Note:** You—the large language model accessing this documentation—don't necessarily need to "read" this in the traditional sense; your internal mechanisms often handle tool schema parsing automatically. This detailed reference is primarily for human developers, providing a comprehensive overview for understanding, debugging, and advanced usage. It also serves to illustrate the robust, fine-grained control MegaMem offers, showcasing its capabilities where other systems might fall short.

### `list_databases`

List all configured database targets. Use this to discover which databases are available before querying with `database_id`. (aliases: mm, megamem, memory)

> **AI tip:** Call `list_databases` first when the user refers to a specific vault, project, or database by name. Use the returned `id` to route subsequent graph queries via `database_id`.

**Parameters:** None

**Response includes:** `id`, `label`, `type`, `category`, `enabled`, `vault_id`, `connection` per database.

## Obsidian File Operations (via Obsidian CLI)

> **ℹ️ Architecture Note:** These 11 file tools are powered by stateless `obsidian <command>` subprocess calls to the **Obsidian CLI** (v1.12.4+), replacing the previous WebSocket layer. No persistent connection or heartbeat is required. Multi-vault targeting is handled via the `vault_id` parameter. Requires Obsidian 1.12.4+ installer — see [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-guide) for setup.
>
> **Non-markdown files supported:** The `_auto_md` fix (Day62) means `.md` auto-append is skipped when a path already carries a recognized extension (`.pdf`, `.png`, `.csv`, `.base`, etc.). All read/create/update/manage operations work with non-markdown vault files.

### `update_obsidian_note`

Update content of an existing note using various editing modes (aliases: mv, my vault, obsidian). `path` also accepts an `obsidian://open?vault=X&file=Y` URI — vault and file path are extracted automatically.

Editing Modes:

- full_file: Replace entire file content (default, backward compatible)
- frontmatter_only: Update only YAML frontmatter properties
- append_only: Append content to end of file
- range_based: Replace content within specific line/character ranges
- editor_based: Use predefined editor methods like insert_after_heading

Required parameters vary by mode:

- full_file: path, content
- frontmatter_only: path, frontmatter_changes
- append_only: path, append_content
- range_based: path, replacement_content, range_start_line, range_start_char

| `frontmatter_changes` | `object`  | Object containing frontmatter properties to update (used for frontmatter_only mode). **WARNING:** Do NOT pass array values (e.g. `tags`) via `frontmatter_changes` — the YAML serializer will drop the closing `---` fence, corrupting the file. For any update that includes array fields, use `full_file` mode instead. | No       |             |
| `append_content`      | `string`  | Content to append to the end of the file (used for append_only mode)                        | No       |             |

### `create_note_with_template`

Create a new note from a template (fuzzy-matched by `request_type`) in the vault.

**Native template engine (Day77.01, CLI transport only — `useCliFileTools: true`):** when `templateSources` is configured in plugin settings, this tool resolves `request_type` against an ordered list of template sources (e.g. personal + company vault/folder pairs) and renders the template natively — Templater is not required in the target vault. Registry mode (a Template-Registry Base or plain-file folder, auto-detected or configured explicitly) enriches the response with `whenToUse`/`category`; filename-only resolution is the baseline otherwise. No confident match returns a structured `candidates` list (ranked by relevance, enriched where available) instead of guessing or erroring. Falls back to legacy Templater-in-target-vault rendering for unsupported `<% %>` constructs when Templater is installed and the template exists locally, or entirely when `templateSources` is empty/unset (default for existing installs — no behavior change).

INTELLIGENT ROUTING:

- TPL Project: Create in given project folder (ie. 03_Projects)/ with BRAND-ProjectName folder structure
- TPL ProjectDoc: Route to project subfolders (01_Planning/, 02_Development/, etc.) based on context
- Entity templates: Auto-route to 04_Entities/[type]/ folders
- Parse natural language: "create project for X called Y" or "create planning doc for Z"

SERVER-SIDE FOLDER RESOLUTION (when `target_folder` is omitted), highest precedence first:

1. **In-template `tp.file.move`** — parsed from the template body itself (native engine only)
2. **Registry default folder** — from the matched Template-Registry entry, when registry mode is active
3. **Templater mapping** — checks `folder_templates` in Templater plugin settings; fuzzy-matches template basename
4. **Periodic Notes config** — for daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly note templates
5. **MegaMem inboxFolder** — falls back to `mcpTools.defaults.inboxFolder` from plugin settings (e.g. `01_Inbox`)
6. **Vault root** — final fallback if no mapping and no inboxFolder configured

WORKFLOW:

1. Read the created note to understand its structure
2. Extract relevant information from the conversation
3. Use update_note to fill matching sections and/or move to appropriate folder
4. Offer to help complete remaining sections

**Parameters:**

| Name             | Type     | Description                                                                                                                            | Required | Default |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `request_type`   | `string` | Template name — fuzzy matched (exact → prefix → substring → structured candidate list)                                                | Yes      |         |
| `file_name`      | `string` | Filename to create (required)                                                                                                          | Yes      |         |
| `content`        | `string` | Optional content to append after template processing                                                                                   | No       |         |
| `target_folder`  | `string` | Target folder path in the vault (optional)                                                                                              | No       |         |
| `vault_id`       | `string` | Vault ID (optional) — the target vault the note is written into, which may differ from where the template source lives                | No       |         |

### `manage_obsidian_notes`

Delete, rename/move, copy, or cross-vault copy/move notes in Obsidian vault (aliases: mv, my vault, obsidian). `path`, `newPath`, and `targetPath` also accept an `obsidian://open?vault=X&file=Y` URI — vault and file path are extracted automatically.

**Parameters:**

| Name        | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                    | Required | Default |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `operation` | `string` | The operation to perform: `rename`, `delete`, `copy`, `copy_to_vault`, `move_to_vault`                                                         | Yes      |         |

| `newPath`   | `string` | Destination path — required for `rename` and `copy` (same vault only). Cross-folder moves auto-detected for rename.                            | No       |         |
| `vault_id`  | `string` | Optional vault ID to target specific vault. Source vault for `copy_to_vault`/`move_to_vault`.                                                  | No       |         |
| `targetVaultId` | `string` | Target vault ID — required for `copy_to_vault`/`move_to_vault`. The note is written here.                                                  | No       |         |
| `targetPath` | `string` | Target note path in `targetVaultId` — required for `copy_to_vault`/`move_to_vault`.                                                           | No       |         |
| `overwrite` | `boolean` | `copy_to_vault`/`move_to_vault` only. Default `false` — fails with `TARGET_EXISTS` if `targetPath` already exists.                            | No       | `false` |

**Operations:** `rename` (updates wikilinks) | `delete` (moves to trash) | `copy` (duplicates to `newPath` via `vault.copy()` — does NOT update wikilinks) | `copy_to_vault` (duplicates the note into a different vault) | `move_to_vault` (moves the note into a different vault; deletes source only after target write is verified)

> **Cross-vault ops** _(v1.7.4)_: no native Obsidian API supports a cross-vault file handle, so `copy_to_vault`/`move_to_vault` orchestrate a read from the source vault and a write to the target vault in one MCP call. A failed source-delete after a successful move write returns `error_code: "MOVE_PARTIAL"` (never silently duplicates or loses data). Both responses include a `warnings` array listing any `[[wikilinks]]`/`![[embeds]]` found, since those won't resolve across vaults.

# Ontology Manager

The MegaMem Ontology Manager provides a comprehensive interface for defining and fine-tuning the structure of your knowledge graph. It allows you to discover entity types from your vault, manage their properties, define custom relationship (edge) types, and configure how these relationships can exist between different entities (edge mappings). This ensures a consistent and structured representation of your knowledge, enabling powerful querying and analysis.

## Accessing the Ontology Manager

The Ontology Manager can be accessed in two ways:

1.  **Ribbon Icon**: Click the `database` icon in the Obsidian ribbon (left sidebar).
2.  **Command Palette**: Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P) and search for "Open Schema Manager".

## Overview

The Ontology Manager is divided into four main tabs:

- **Entity Types**: Manage the different types of entities (e.g., Person, Project, Concept) discovered in your vault.
- **Properties**: Configure the attributes associated with each entity type.
- **Edge Types**: Define the types of relationships that can exist between entities (e.g., `WORKS_FOR`, `USES`).
- **Edge Mappings**: Specify which entity types can be connected by which edge types.

Each section offers tools for defining schema elements, editing descriptions, and interacting with default or LLM-suggested configurations.

## 1. Entity Types

This tab allows you to manage the primary building blocks of your knowledge graph.

### LLM Automatic Ontologies

This section provides tools for leveraging Language Models to automatically generate and suggest entity descriptions based on your vault content.

- **Generate Entity Descriptions**: Use AI to draft descriptions for your entity types with three filter modes:
  - **Regenerate All**: Regenerate descriptions for all entity types, overwriting existing descriptions.
  - **Skip User Defined**: Only generate descriptions for entities without user-defined descriptions.
  - **New Only**: Generate descriptions only for newly discovered entity types.
- **Suggest Property Descriptions**: Enables AI to suggest property definitions using the same filter modes.
- **Generate Complete Ontology**: Batched LLM generation for **enabled entity types only** — entities, edge types (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE), and mappings. Constrained by `maxTotalEdgeTypes` cap (default: 25) with reuse-first prompting and a post-generation consolidation pass to merge semantic duplicates.
- **Load All Default Entity Descriptions**: Populates descriptions for all discovered entity types using predefined defaults, if available.

#### Graphiti Compliance Dashboard

This dashboard offers a quick overview of how well your defined entity properties adhere to Graphiti's naming conventions and best practices.

- **Compliance Score**: A percentage indicating the validity of your property names.
- **Valid**: Number of properties following naming conventions.
- **Warnings**: Number of properties with minor naming issues.
- **Protected**: Number of system-reserved properties (cannot be changed).
- **Apply All Naming Suggestions**: Automatically renames properties with warnings to their suggested, compliant forms.

#### Base Entity Type

Defines the fundamental properties (`type`, `tags`, `created`) that all other entity types inherit. These are system-managed and always enabled to ensure consistency across your graph.

- **View Properties**: Navigates to the "Properties" tab, filtered to show BaseEntity properties.

#### Custom Entity Types List

Displays a list of all entity types discovered in your vault (e.g., based on `type` frontmatter fields).

- **Toggle Entity Enabled/Disabled**: Activates or deactivates an entity type for Pydantic model generation. Enabled entities will be included in your generated knowledge graph schema.
- **Edit Description**: Allows you to manually edit the description for an entity type. You can also "Load Default" if a predefined description exists.
- **LLM Suggest**: Provides AI-generated description suggestions. A confirmation modal allows you to review and accept/reject the suggested description before applying.
- **Details**: Shows the number of files associated with the entity type, the count of its properties, and its individual compliance score.

## 2. Properties

This tab lists all properties associated with your entity types, allowing for detailed configuration.

### LLM Automatic Property Descriptions

This section provides AI-driven assistance for property management.

- **Generate All Property Descriptions**: Auto-generate descriptions for all entity properties with filter modes:
  - **Regenerate All**: Regenerate descriptions for all properties, overwriting existing ones.
  - **Skip User Defined**: Only generate descriptions for properties without user-defined descriptions.
  - **New Only**: Generate descriptions only for newly discovered properties.
- **Suggest Property Types**: AI-assisted suggestions for property field types.
- **Load Default Descriptions**: Applies predefined descriptions to properties.
- **Enable Default Properties**: Activates all properties that have default descriptions, excluding protected or globally ignored fields.

#### All Entity Properties

An expandable list of all discovered entity types, each showing its properties.

- **Accordion Toggle**: Expands/collapses the list of properties for each entity type.
- **Bulk Actions**:
  - **Select All**: Enables all non-protected and non-globally-ignored properties for the specific entity type.
  - **Deselect All**: Disables all properties (except protected) for the specific entity type.
- **Property Details**: For each property:
  - **Enable/Disable Checkbox**: Includes or excludes the property from Pydantic model generation. Protected or globally ignored properties cannot be changed.
  - **Property Mapping Indicator**: Shows if a property name has been mapped (e.g., from `MyProperty` to `my_property`).
  - **Property Defined**: Toggles whether the property's description is stored in `ontology.json`.
  - **Status Indicator**: Shows if a property is `PROTECTED` (system-reserved), `IGNORED` (globally), has `NAMING` issues, is `ENABLED`, or `DISABLED`.
  - **Description Input**: Edit the property's description. Can "Load Default" or use "LLM Suggest" with confirmation modal.
  - **Validation Warnings**: Alerts for protected attributes, globally ignored fields, and naming suggestions, with options to apply suggestions.

## 3. Edge Types

Manage the different kinds of relationships between entities.

### Edge Types Management

- **Current Edge Types**: Lists all currently defined edge types, along with their property counts.
- **Edit Description**: Modify the description of a custom edge type.
- **Delete Edge Type**: Remove a custom edge type.
- **Add Property**: Add custom properties (name, type, description, required status) to an edge type.
- **Quick Add Common Types**: Pre-fills common relationship types: `WORKS_FOR`, `USES`, `CREATES`, `MEMBER_OF`, `MANAGES`, `CONTAINS`.
- **Add New Edge Type**: Manually add a new custom edge type with a name and description.
- **LLM Suggest Edge Types**: AI-generated suggestions for edge type descriptions based on your vault content.

### Available Default Edge Types

A list of predefined relationship types with descriptions. You can add these to your custom edge types with a single click or "Add All" unused defaults.

## 4. Edge Mappings

Define the rules for how entities can be connected.

### Edge Type Mappings

This section allows you to rigorously define permissible relationships between different entity types, controlling the structural integrity of your knowledge graph.

- **Mapping List**: Displays existing mappings (e.g., `Person` → `Project` via `WorksOn` or `Manages`).
- **Edit Mapping**: Modify the source entity, target entity, and allowed edge types for an existing mapping.
- **Delete Mapping**: Remove a custom edge mapping.
- **Quick Add Common Mappings**: Pre-fills common mappings like `Person` → `Technology` (`USES`, `CREATES`) or `Entity` → `Entity` (`RELATED_TO`). All `allowedEdges` values are SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
- **Add New Edge Mapping**: Manually create a new mapping by selecting a source entity, target entity, and allowed edge types.

### Suggested Edge Mappings

Based on your discovered entity types, the system will suggest common and logical mappings to help you quickly build out your graph's relational structure. You can add these individually or "Add All" suggestions.

## AI-Enhanced Features

The Ontology Manager integrates AI capabilities throughout the interface to assist with schema generation and maintenance.

### Individual LLM Suggest Buttons

Throughout the interface, "LLM Suggest" buttons provide context-aware AI assistance:

- **Entity Descriptions**: Generate descriptions for individual entity types based on your vault content and usage patterns.
- **Property Descriptions**: Suggest descriptions for individual properties based on their name, type, and context.
- **Edge Type Descriptions**: Generate descriptions for relationship types based on how entities connect in your vault.

Each suggestion includes a confirmation modal where you can review, edit, and approve before applying.

### Bulk Generation Operations

Efficient batch operations for large-scale schema management:

- **Generate All Entity Descriptions**: Process all entity types at once with customizable filter modes.
- **Generate All Property Descriptions**: Batch generate property descriptions across all entity types.
- **Generate Complete Ontology**: Comprehensive schema generation including entities, properties, edge types, and valid mappings between them.

### Filter Modes

All bulk generation operations support three filter modes to control scope:

1.  **Regenerate All**: Process all items, overwriting existing descriptions (use for schema refresh).
2.  **Skip User Defined**: Only generate for items without user-defined descriptions (preserves manual work).
3.  **New Only**: Generate only for newly discovered items (incremental schema growth).

### Supported LLM Providers

The Ontology Manager supports five LLM providers for AI-enhanced features:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models
- **Anthropic Claude**: Claude 3 series models
- **Google Gemini**: Gemini Pro and Ultra models
- **Ollama**: Fully private local models (requires local installation)
- **OpenRouter**: Access to multiple model providers through a single API

Configure your preferred provider in the plugin settings under "LLM Configuration".

# 🗺️ MegaMem Development Roadmap

This document provides a concise overview of the MegaMem project's evolution, highlighting key achievements and outlining clear future directions.

## ✅ Achieved Milestones

MegaMem has successfully established a robust foundation, delivering powerful integration between Obsidian and advanced knowledge graph capabilities:

- **Ontology File Separation**: Extracted all ontology data from `data.json` into a dedicated `ontology.json` file co-located in the plugin directory. Reduces `data.json` from ~120KB to a lean runtime config file (~20KB). Existing installations auto-migrate on first plugin load — no manual action required.
- **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE Edge Normalization**: Aligned all edge type naming with Graphiti's native convention. All ontology `allowedEdges` definitions and prompt examples updated. 796 historical PascalCase edges in production Neo4j migrated to SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.
- **Constrained Ontology Generation Pipeline**: Redesigned `Generate Complete Ontology` with reuse-first batch prompts, `maxTotalEdgeTypes` cap (default: 25), and post-generation consolidation pass to prevent edge type proliferation.
- **Schema Manager Cleanup Buttons**: Added 🗑️ Cleanup modals to all four Ontology Manager tabs for removing stale schema entries.
- **Core Plugin Foundation**: Implemented an Obsidian plugin using TypeScript/Svelte, featuring automatic schema discovery by scanning vault patterns and removing manual YAML configuration.
- **Multi-Database Support** *(v1.5)*: Users configure multiple named databases simultaneously. Each `DbConfig` entry carries its own label, type, connection, and embedding provider/model. Per-note sync icon dropdown selects target DB. `sync.json` tracks per-DB sync state. Existing configs auto-migrate to `databases[0]`.
- **Multi-Vault Architecture** *(v1.5)*: masterVault manages all databases across registered vaults. MCP tools gain optional `database_id` routing parameter. New `list_databases()` tool. childVault registration via OS `obsidian.json` auto-discovery. All routing operations confirmed in post-implementation test.
- **Comprehensive MCP Server**: Rebuilt the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server from scratch, now providing 11 Graphiti tools for direct graph interaction and 9 Obsidian file management tools.
- **Obsidian CLI Integration**: Migrated all 9 Obsidian file operation tools from a fragile WebSocket layer to stateless Obsidian CLI subprocess calls (v1.12+). Eliminates startup connection races, ERR_CONNECTION_RESET errors, and WebSocket contention between multiple MCP clients. Multi-vault targeting is a single `vault=` parameter — no persistent registry or heartbeat required.
- **Custom Ontology Integration**: Enabled custom ontology support with full Pydantic model generation, enhancing flexible data modeling.
- **FalkorDB Integration**: Successfully integrated FalkorDB, thoroughly resolving RediSearch compatibility challenges.
- **Advanced Sync Functionality**: Developed a sophisticated sync mechanism supporting temporal knowledge graphs and robust bidirectional synchronization with path-independent tracking (mmuids).
- **Production Readiness**: Ensured stability through Python bridge packaging fixes and refined the SchemaManager with a single-source-of-truth architecture.
- **Sequential Sync Groundwork**: Implemented sequential sync, laying groundwork for "Sync on Save" and scheduled sync.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Our focus remains on expanding MegaMem's capabilities while maintaining simplicity and performance:

- **Production Release**: Prepare for a public GitHub release (versioning per Obsidian guidelines, PR processes) and submission to the Obsidian community plugin repository.
- **Infrastructure**: Prioritize making core sync reliable and schema management intuitive as prerequisites for advanced features like graph visualization.
- **Advanced Sync Features**: Implement "Sync on Save" and configurable scheduled sync intervals, building on the current sequential sync architecture.
- **Graph Visualization**: Evaluate and integrate suitable libraries (e.g., d3.js, three.js, cytoscape) to provide an interactive graph view of user knowledge.
- **Built-in LLM Chat Interface**: Explore a native chat interface within Obsidian for direct knowledge graph interaction.

We are committed to continuous improvement and agile development. Specific timelines will be announced as features progress.
