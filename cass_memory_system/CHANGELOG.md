## [0.2.14] -- 2026-08-25

Maintenance release. Everything on `main` since [0.2.13](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/releases/tag/v0.2.13) (2026-07-28): four user-facing fixes, no new features and no behaviour changes to existing commands, so this is a patch bump.

### Fixed

- `cm doctor` can no longer hang: `cass stats --json` is now bounded by a 30s timeout ([`aecd405`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/aecd405)).
- First run now produces working defaults, and `reflect` honours the CLI auto-fallback that `doctor` advertises ([`ad5219c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/ad5219c), #66, #67).
- The default-budget notice is emitted once, and the budget is baked into the config on the first successful `reflect` instead of being re-derived ([`72199a7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/72199a7), #68).
- Inline `[cass: ...]` feedback markers now accept hyphenated bullet IDs ([`89977c5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/89977c5), #64).

### Gate

- `tsc --noEmit`: clean
- `bun test --isolate`: **2636 passed, 4 skipped, 0 failed** across 142 files

### Artifacts

Same asset set as 0.2.13, deliberately: `cass-memory-linux-x64`, `cass-memory-macos-arm64`, `cass-memory-macos-x64`, `cass-memory-windows-x64.exe`, each with a `.sha256` sidecar, plus `install.sh.sha256`.

`install.sh` resolves only the three linux/macOS targets — it has no Windows branch — but 0.2.13 published a Windows binary for direct download, so it is published here too. Dropping it would silently regress a platform for anyone who fetches that asset manually.

Verified before upload: architecture via `file` (ELF x86-64, Mach-O arm64, Mach-O x86_64, PE32+), and the linux and macOS-arm64 binaries were executed and asked for their own version, both reporting `0.2.14`. The linux binary carries a **glibc 2.17** floor.

Not verified by execution: `cass-memory-macos-x64` and `cass-memory-windows-x64.exe`, for lack of an Intel Mac and a Windows host. Both were confirmed to be the correct binary format for their platform.

---

## [0.2.13] -- 2026-07-28

### Security

- **Pin `protobufjs` to 7.6.5 across the compiled dependency graph**, removing
  the vulnerable 6.11.4 runtime covered by
  [GHSA-xq3m-2v4x-88gg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xq3m-2v4x-88gg)
  from standalone `cm` binaries.
- **Raise `yaml` to the patched 2.8.3+ line**, addressing
  [GHSA-48c2-rrv3-qjmp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-48c2-rrv3-qjmp).
- **Pin the AWS XML builder to 3.972.37**, removing vulnerable transitive
  `fast-xml-builder` and `fast-xml-parser` releases from the Bedrock provider
  dependency graph.
- Add a lockfile regression test that fails if `protobufjs` is no longer
  overridden to the audited release or the patched AWS XML builder regresses.

### Reliability

- Bound Cass-backed MCP concurrency and queueing so one expensive request cannot
  monopolize the server ([#61](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/issues/61)).
- Handle large `cass timeline` responses with configurable buffers and timeouts
  ([#62](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/issues/62)).
- Apply the configured embedding backend consistently, including Ollama's
  official `all-minilm` model mapping
  ([#63](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/issues/63)).
- Bound Ollama embedding requests with a 30-second timeout instead of allowing
  an unavailable endpoint to hang indefinitely.
- Honor `disableStructuredOutputs` for OpenAI-compatible gateways.
- Preserve diary-derived rule provenance and stop mixed auto-graded sessions
  from blanket-marking injected rules harmful
  ([#58](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/issues/58),
  [#56](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/issues/56)).

### Release and Test Hardening

- Use Bun exclusively for post-install processing and isolate test files to
  prevent shared stdout, environment, and working-directory state from leaking.
- Upload only explicit platform binaries from fresh release jobs so stale
  `dist` contents cannot enter a release.
- Bring MCP response and structured-output tests in line with the current wire
  formats, and make Cass/LLM-dependent doctor tests hermetic.

## [0.2.12] -- 2026-06-21

### Reflection Pipeline -- ship the `cm reflect` fixes

These fixes were already merged to `main` but had not landed in any tagged /
brew-installable build, so users on `v0.2.11` (the prior Homebrew latest) still
saw `cm reflect` produce **zero deltas on every provider**. This release ships
them. ([#55](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/issues/55))

- **Unblock CLI-provider reflect (0 deltas).** CLI prompts omit JSON schemas, so the
  `agent` field was wrongly required and the diary timeout was hardcoded; also drop
  `ACCEPT_WITH_CAUTION` from the embedded reflector ([79e3a9f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/79e3a9fd)) ([#54](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/issues/54))
- **Accept `duration: null` in the diary schema** and make LLM timeouts configurable, so
  slower gateway / CLI providers no longer fail at a fixed 30s `extractDiary` timeout
  ([2e63e9b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/2e63e9ba)) ([#53](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/issues/53))
- **Correct the harmful-delta reason enum** in the embedded reflector schema
  ([e3e9f06](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/e3e9f063))
- **Widen the auto-draft validation bypass** to `successCount === 0`
  ([523b6f9](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/523b6f9a)) ([#54](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/issues/54) finding A)

### TOON Output Format

- **TOON format** for token-efficient agent output -- reduces token cost for LLM consumers of `cm` output ([7dd4424](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/7dd44248997002d53870c579e5ddea8be5043247))

## [v0.2.2] -- 2026-01-05

**Release**: [cass-memory v0.2.2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/releases/tag/v0.2.2) | Tag: [`v0.2.2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/6fa8953fb27082afb791b87e9faa37efcec1975d) | Published: 2026-01-05

A focused patch release improving the installation experience.

### Installer Reliability

- **Redirect-based version resolution** -- the installer now uses GitHub's redirect behavior (`/releases/latest` -> `/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`) instead of the API, eliminating rate limiting (60/hr for unauthenticated) and cross-platform JSON parsing issues ([c694251](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/c694251a83a0f7d78cc77fd11df79e536d24b6cc))
- **Fixed concurrent install protection** -- the lock file path was incorrectly using PID expansion (`$$`), causing each installer process to create its own unique lock file; now uses static `/tmp/cass-memory-install.lock` ([6bfdd6a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/6bfdd6a247afca1d15105cb7502a7bc6d2da24dc))

### Documentation

- Move installation comment outside code block in README for better formatting ([184951c](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/184951cd7adcef485e3fbeb3cd1a3f71df25dd24))

## [v0.2.1] -- 2026-01-02

**Release**: [cass-memory v0.2.1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/releases/tag/v0.2.1) | Tag: [`v0.2.1`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/afa4e6105151865cf7620ec7b4d79d60038aa302) | Published: 2026-01-03

A major stabilization release that fixed critical session discovery bugs, introduced the Project Hot Stove trauma/guard system, added dependency injection for testing, and dramatically expanded test coverage.

### Critical Bug Fixes (Session Discovery)

- **Resolve `timeline.groups.flatMap` error** -- fixes `cm reflect` failing when cass timeline returns groups as an object instead of an array; now uses `--since Nd` format instead of `--days N` ([7390a7b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/7390a7b8868c04e6cb415d68a623ec63be4e98b9))
- Add String coercion for timeline timestamps to prevent type errors ([287a5c6](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/287a5c6db7110819ae16a872371cb135fe1c4667))
- Improve Codex CLI session parsing: handle nested `payload.content` format, fallback to direct JSONL parsing when cass returns >50% UNKNOWN entries ([7390a7b](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/7390a7b8868c04e6cb415d68a623ec63be4e98b9))
- Add size limit for fallback session parsing to prevent OOM ([3b88720](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/commit/3b8872000344a5a9357d4d603ba691aee9dbe4e2))

### Project Hot Stove (Trauma/Guard System)
