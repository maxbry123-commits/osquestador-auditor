# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Sync and async `memories.query()` for exact structured filtering through the REST API,
  including scalar `extra_metadata`, subject, type, session, trust tier, branch, and pagination.
- Sync and async `memories.fulltext_search()` for pure MatrixOne full-text search with
  exact scalar `extra_metadata_filter` and fixed-field SQL pre-filters, without vector or
  graph retrieval. Session filtering is strict and the endpoint is intentionally not exposed
  by MCP.

### Fixed
- `ping()` no longer wraps `MemoriaAuthError` / `MemoriaNotFoundError` and other API errors
  into `MemoriaConnectionError`; callers can now distinguish network failures from API errors.
- `_map_error`: empty response body no longer produces duplicate status code in the error
  message (e.g. `"HTTP 404: HTTP 404"` → `"HTTP 404: Not Found"`).
